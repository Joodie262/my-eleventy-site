<p>Got all my monthly accounting and tracking done for August first thing today. I basically took the whole month off from social media, so that part was quick. I even restocked some low items and filled orders for tomorrow. It was a deeply productive long weekend, but it also made me pretty tired.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt believe I totally forgot about the 2026 Hobonichi release time for over an hour yesterday. I did watch the Yoseka Countdown party livestream on YouTube once I made my purchases. Haha, just participating on my own weird timeline.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 1: What‚Äôs your favorite thing to wear when the seasons change?</strong><br>
I love boots when it‚Äôs colder. But the hoodie is a classic. Nothing cozier than a hoodie. I have a lot of favorites and miss them in the summer. Plus that big pocket in front is just plain practical. Not a ton of women‚Äôs clothes with pockets that large. Plus they just feel heavy and that‚Äôs just so relaxing.</p>
<p>Fall is the best season for fashion. Love a plaid button down or a light jacket, or a fuzzy fleece. Oh there‚Äôs so many options! I can‚Äôt wait for it to cool down outside now.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Phew! Yesterday was a lot of work. My back is sore today. And now that I moved furniture around I sort of need to go through piles of stationery that had accumulated without a home. So I probably need to spend most of today in a similar &quot;cleaning mode&quot; even though I'm tired. Maybe tomorrow will be my recovery day.</p>

<p>Then... because FATIGUE‚ÄîI watched a Marvel movie with M. And I totally forgot the Hobonichi launch!!! I didn‚Äôt remember for over an hour when I got upstairs for the night time and looked at my phone. Soooo I got everything I wanted but I had to buy from two stores. Not perfect but not a big deal either. Now it‚Äôs just the wait for what will feel like an eternity before it all arrives. Did all USA shops since the tariffs are a giant mystery. Can‚Äôt wait to see people unbox their planners in vlogs on YouTube.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I spent the whole day cleaning one little corner of my bedroom. It somehow got a bit of mold. I think I pushed my nightstand too close to a wall that gets cold in Spring and Winter, so the air stopped circulating. So yeah. Scrubbed it all off. Then let it soak with vinegar for an hour. Tomorrow I‚Äôll do a final layer of Borax because it‚Äôs supposed to inhibit growth. But I also got a fan and a DampRid to keep that corner dry forever. It sucks that it grew at all. I‚Äôve never had that happen before. But it was just my furniture choice and me not knowing to check that created this problem so it shouldn‚Äôt happen again. I might even repaint with that special Kilz paint so it‚Äôs even more secure. But I need to move my bed which just‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt moveable. So IDK how to solve that problem yet.</p>
<p>So yeah, a rough day but I figured since it‚Äôs a long weekend for me it would be a good time to get it done. I cut some sticker sheets to add to my inventory too. So I can only hope tomorrow is a little more balanced with‚Ä¶ fun or rest. Oh and how could I forget! We got our first local sweet corn of the season. Some of it was affected by our recent flooding so some kernels were burst open, but it was so yummy. 1st one is the best!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I'm having a hard time trying to decide what Hobonichi planners to get for 2026. I know I need the A5 Avec‚Äîthat‚Äôs my daily darling. But if I design stickers for the other sizes I want something to test them in. I like to see something tangible before I release it. I do have empty pages from my 2025 A6 and Weeks but I feel weird combining tests with real planning for some reason? IDK. It‚Äôs just expensive too. I‚Äôm trying to save up for a laptop this year and I just don‚Äôt know how to decide. I used my A6 + Weeks very sporadically/randomly. The A6 was more mental health/personal but I find it hard to write in at that size. I don‚Äôt do small well. I try not to feel guilty for empty pages but with money being a lot tighter I‚Äôm trying to be careful.</p>
<p>Later: Today was kind of frustrating really. My main cut machine malfunctioned and I spent over an hour troubleshooting. And my 2nd machine did fail later in the evening too. On a day I was finding work a bit overwhelming before any of that happened. Just nothing to say other than: annoyed. At least I got all of the September journaling prompts done and posted everywhere. Just a mixed bag of a day. Tried my best.</p>

<p>I watched a random YouTube video last night from Wired (I think) where they asked a teacher a bunch of questions. She had the best energy and attitude ever.

<p>I wish all teachers could be empathetic and flexible with all the unique types of students.

<p>Life happens. I wish teachers had more resources and more influence over customizing their teaching for all the types of kids they teach. It just brought up so many emotions.

<p>Another perfect weather day today. But it‚Äôs a workday, so I‚Äôll be stuck inside for most of it. Oh well! This whole week is going to be cooler than average, so I‚Äôll just embrace it when I can. I can‚Äôt believe August is already ending this week.

<p>Tomorrow morning our furnace is getting its annual servicing. Hopefully the temp stays cool so running the furnace doesn‚Äôt warm me up. Hah!</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 25: What‚Äôs the most ‚Äúyou‚Äù thing you‚Äôve done this month?</strong><br>
Easy. I started a large crochet project. Made a lot of fast initial progress‚Ä¶ and then when the task felt slightly overwhelming and slow, I halted completely. The dopamine just wasn‚Äôt hitting. Sooo‚Ä¶ my poor Mushroom Guy plushie has a head and 2/3 of a body but now has just been abandoned for an unknown amount of time. CLASSIC ME!</p>
<p>I have my place marked and all the instructions are marked too. So at any point I can pick it up again. It‚Äôs just the most ‚Äúme‚Äù thing ever. I‚Äôm a super strong starter of projects. Finishing is not my specialty, however. At least I try new things and get joy from the parts I do!</p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt too hot to function outside today! Yay!! I went for a walk with M. at a local park. The sun was warm, and there was a nice breeze. We did get attacked by mosquitos in some parts though, which was awful. Totally ruins the peaceful nature vibe. I hate them so much. I may stick to beach-only outdoor trips until we get a first frost here. The flooding probably made them a lot worse. Also there‚Äôs still a huge pile of flooding trash in our whole neighborhood. But we got an email that everything was picked up. That‚Äôs going to be a problem!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 24: Which fictional universe would you happily retire in?</strong><br>
I‚Äôm trying to think of a magical world that isn‚Äôt super dangerous. The faerie world in the Emily Wilde books sounded fun (but not if they abduct me or anything). I haven‚Äôt read a lot of fiction where the world is much better than the real one. If it was a perfect world it wouldn‚Äôt make an interesting story. I don‚Äôt think I read or watch the right things to answer this one.</p>
<p>Ah I thought of one: <em>Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service</em>. Just chill lite-witch vibes. No big scaries. Just a hint of magic in a cozy seaside town. But I‚Äôd have a little doggy friend instead of a cat. Sorry cats‚Äîyou make me sneeze!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello to the weekend. I feel torn on Saturdays between doing shop work and doing a more traditional off-work weekend. I could go either way. I have some momentum going from yesterday. I don‚Äôt often finalize art, go through all the steps and list a product all in one day. I did reorganize my inventory storage yesterday so now I have room for more sticker sheets. I have a lot of my basic functional sheets that continue to sell well. But I‚Äôm having more fun with decorative and Cookie character stickers. I feel like you need a lot to choose from to really enjoy a new character in your planner, so I‚Äôm just slowly building up Cookie‚Äôs Collection. I hope I‚Äôm right about that. My recent Cousin kit sells well too. Those take weeks to finalize the art for though, so it‚Äôs harder to start new ones.</p>
<p>Later‚Ä¶ I changed my sticker sheet pricing finally. I did some research into ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù and I realized I was under-pricing my work. I kept prices lower on my Shopify because there are less fees on each order. I hope everyone is okay with it. I just haven‚Äôt yet made enough to cover material costs, so hopefully this will help bridge that gap. Also updated my shop theme to the latest version. Yay!</p>
