The waves were up really high so all the rocks were underwater (well, the good ones at least!) but I didn’t mind. I did get a tiny blister on my pinkie toe because I wore my sandals when they were wet.

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I'm having a hard time trying to decide what Hobonichi planners to get for 2026. I know I need the A5 Avec—that’s my daily darling. But if I design stickers for the other sizes I want something to test them in. I like to see something tangible before I release it. I do have empty pages from my 2025 A6 and Weeks but I feel weird combining tests with real planning for some reason? IDK. It’s just expensive too. I’m trying to save up for a laptop this year and I just don’t know how to decide. I used my A6 + Weeks very sporadically/randomly. The A6 was more mental health/personal but I find it hard to write in at that size. I don’t do small well. I try not to feel guilty for empty pages but with money being a lot tighter I’m trying to be careful.</p>
<p>Later: Today was kind of frustrating really. My main cut machine malfunctioned and I spent over an hour troubleshooting. And my 2nd machine did fail later in the evening too. On a day I was finding work a bit overwhelming before any of that happened. Just nothing to say other than: annoyed. At least I got all of the September journaling prompts done and posted everywhere. Just a mixed bag of a day. Tried my best.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I watched a random YouTube video last night from Wired (I think) where they asked a teacher a bunch of questions. She had the best energy and attitude ever. I actually teared up because she seemed so awesome and caring. But then I couldn’t fall asleep because it brought up so many emotions.</p>
<p>The public school system failed me. It’s always hard for me to think about high school particularly. So my mind just couldn’t quiet down for sleep. My heart aches for any child who doesn’t fit perfectly into that system (or just can’t find a way to make it work).</p>
<p>I wish all teachers could be empathetic and flexible with all the unique types of students. She said something I loved: “Every student is in their own right place at the right time.” Like if someone learns “faster” or “slower,” it’s all okay—that’s just their pace. How silly is it that just because you’re at a certain age you’re all supposed to know the exact same stuff.</p>
<p>Life happens. I wish teachers had more resources and more influence over customizing their teaching for all the types of kids they teach. It just brought up so many emotions. I wish I could have thrived more in school. I wish every child had an amazing teacher who was kind and compassionate to them. I wish emotional skills and kindness were part of every education.</p>
<p>I wish. I wish. Kids deserve better than a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

<p>Another perfect weather day today. But it’s a workday, so I’ll be stuck inside for most of it. Oh well! This whole week is going to be cooler than average, so I’ll just embrace it when I can.

<p><strong>Prompt 25: What’s the most “you” thing you’ve done this month?</strong><br>
Easy. I started a large crochet project. Made a lot of fast initial progress… and then when the task felt slightly overwhelming and slow, I halted completely. The dopamine just wasn’t hitting. Sooo… my poor Mushroom Guy plushie has a head and 2/3 of a body but now has just been abandoned for an unknown amount of time. CLASSIC ME!</p>
<p>I have my place marked and all the instructions are marked too. So at any point I can pick it up again. It’s just the most “me” thing ever. I’m a super strong starter of projects. Finishing is not my specialty, however. At least I try new things and get joy from the parts I do!</p>

<p>It wasn’t too hot to function outside today! Yay!! I went for a walk with M. at a local park. The sun was warm, and there was a nice breeze. We did get attacked by mosquitos in some parts though, which was awful. Totally ruins the peaceful nature vibe. I hate them so much. I may stick to beach-only outdoor trips until we get a first frost here. The flooding probably made them a lot worse. Also there’s still a huge pile of flooding trash in our whole neighborhood.

<p><strong>Prompt 24: Which fictional universe would you happily retire in?</strong><br>
I’m trying to think of a magical world that isn’t super dangerous. The faerie world in the Emily Wilde books sounded fun (but not if they abduct me or anything). I haven’t read a lot of fiction where the world is much better than the real one. If it was a perfect world it wouldn’t make an interesting story. I don’t think I read or watch the right things to answer this one.</p>
<p>Ah I thought of one: <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em>. Just chill lite-witch vibes. No big scaries. Just a hint of magic in a cozy seaside town. But I’d have a little doggy friend instead of a cat. Sorry cats—you make me sneeze!</p>

<p>Hello to the weekend. I feel torn on Saturdays between doing shop work and doing a more traditional off-work weekend. I could go either way. I have some momentum going from yesterday. I don’t often finalize art, go through all the steps and list a product all in one day. I did reorganize my inventory storage yesterday so now I have room for more sticker sheets. I have a lot of my basic functional sheets that continue to sell well. But I’m having more fun with decorative and Cookie character stickers. I feel like you need a lot to choose from to really enjoy a new character in your planner, so I’m just slowly building up Cookie’s Collection. I hope I’m right about that. My recent Cousin kit sells well too. Those take weeks to finalize the art for though, so it’s harder to start new ones.</p>
<p>Later… I changed my sticker sheet pricing finally. I did some research into “competitors” and I realized I was under-pricing my work. I kept prices lower on my Shopify because there are less fees on each order. I hope everyone is okay with it. I just haven’t yet made enough to cover material costs, so hopefully this will help bridge that gap. Also updated my shop theme to the latest version. Yay!</p>

<p>Ugh a medical anxiety day. My stomach is in knots. I’m trying to stay calm but the dentist will just never be my favorite thing. I’ve actually gotten pretty lucky with my teeth. Only ever had one cavity. And I did have to get 4 wisdom teeth removed but that’s it. So I really have nothing to realistically be anxious about. It’s just the invasion of personal space and interacting like a normal human under the stress. No use not going to the dentist because then it would just be for a big problem somewhere down the line. I’ll be an adult today…</p>
<p><strong>Later</strong> All done being an adult. Zero troubles. Got my X-rays. I went to our local fancy grocery store to look for a treat and I found my fav iced butter cookies. So that was my little reward for being a champ. Tomorrow I’ll do more “productive” things but just trying to deal with the anxiety was enough for today.</p>
<p>Oh I got to see the full 2026 Hobo lineup this evening. None of the covers are screaming “must buy” but when I start seeing real people hold them I might change my mind. There is one plaid shirt fabric one that I might get. I might have to go for a cover/book combo if I want one at all since you can’t buy the covers alone for some reason. I do want those index tabs though… I think.</p>

<p>Ugh a medical anxiety day. My stomach is in knots. I’m trying to stay calm but the dentist will just never be my favorite thing. I’ve actually gotten pretty lucky with my teeth. Only ever had one cavity. And I did have to get 4 wisdom teeth removed but that’s it. So I really have nothing to realistically be anxious about. It’s just the invasion of personal space and interacting like a normal human under the stress. No use not going to the dentist because then it would just be for a big problem somewhere down the line. I’ll be an adult today…</p>
<p><strong>Later</strong> All done being an adult. Zero troubles. Got my X-rays. I went to our local fancy grocery store to look for a treat and I found my fav iced butter cookies. So that was my little reward for being a champ. Tomorrow I’ll do more “productive” things but just trying to deal with the anxiety was enough for today.</p>
<p>Oh I got to see the full 2026 Hobo lineup this evening. None of the covers are screaming “must buy” but when I start seeing real people hold them I might change my mind. There is one plaid shirt fabric one that I might get. I might have to go for a cover/book combo if I want one at all since you can’t buy the covers alone for some reason. I do want those index tabs though… I think.</p>

<p>I bought myself some new work shoes. I realized mine are super old (2019) and maybe not very supportive at all anymore. Maybe the new pair will help me feel slightly less exhausted after work. I hope so anyway. I was surprisingly tired last night and I fell asleep a whole hour earlier than usual. Not exactly sure why... maybe that potential burnout I’m trying to avoid. I must need more than usual these days.</p>
<p>I’ve got some shop stuff to finalize today: inventory for the 2026 calendars and the Etsy and TikTok listings. If I feel super energetic I’d like to keep drawing my Halloween sheet too. I really should do a social media post too but that’s probably beyond my capacity today. Maybe I could just do part of it?</p>
<p>Later: I got some decent work done but also sprinkled in my fun HTML website coding so I wouldn’t get too tired of cutting stickers. The calendars are live. I also picked up an Rx I need for tomorrow. It was a good day. Tomorrow I’ll probably be mentally fatigued, so again no huge projects planned. Gotta do as much self care as I can. It might not be too humid so I could actually get to go for a walk for once this month? What a dream. We’ll see what happens.</p>
