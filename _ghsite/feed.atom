<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Happy September Equinox!<br>
Fall starts today but our weather hasn‚Äôt gotten the memo. I have 6 orders to fill today‚Äîwoot woot. I got bit by a fall fashion shopping bug last night. It always happens around my birthday because it‚Äôs the only season I really enjoy shopping for clothes. Sweaters and jackets! Boots and bags! Summer is the worst‚ÄîI always feel too exposed and when it‚Äôs humid I just want to wear whatever absorbs sweat the best LOL.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 22: What‚Äôs a recent comment or message that made you smile?</strong><br>
I was at work last week lugging buckets of water around‚Äîbeing grumpy about it. And someone saw me and said ‚ÄúI like your hair!‚Äù It snapped me totally out of it and made me smile. It felt really genuine. Ever since I switched to my natural waves a year or two ago, no one really comments anymore (which makes sense because it doesn‚Äôt change). But it was nice to hear from a stranger and broke my stormy mood for the moment.</p>
<p>I wish I was better about complimenting other people. I get scared I‚Äôll get stuck in a whole awkward conversation if I open the door so I always chicken out unless I know someone really well already. Introverting is hard like that. I never know when to push myself out of my comfort zone. Will I regret it, or will it be a kind/awesome thing?</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs the last official day of summer! I‚Äôm ready for it to go. It was a very slow morning. No reason but I was just sleepy and cozy in bed. I‚Äôve been working hard lately so I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs okay if today is just chill.</p>
<p>Last night my brain rapidly melted down. Not 100%, but borderline existential crisis mode. I just have an order that went missing but it was marked delivered. So I can‚Äôt file an insurance claim or even a missing mail search. It just makes me sad that I can‚Äôt control the entire process and it costs me‚Äîdespite doing all the ‚Äúright‚Äù things to protect my orders.</p>
<p>So I was just questioning my life decision to run my own business and all the stress that means for me. I just wonder sometimes if working for someone else would make me feel more secure. Ultimately I still believe my shop is absolutely the best choice for me, but there are doubts. And I don‚Äôt have any business partner to talk me through it so I need to give myself the pep talk.</p>
<p>The grind is a real thing and stickers are a brutal business. The amount of SKUs required to stay relevant is a bit wild for one person. And maybe it never makes any profit. At least people are connecting with my art. That‚Äôs a rare and special thing!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Not sure why but my stomach woke me up at 5:30am and I did not feel well at all. Yuck! I eventually got back to sleep but it was not a fun night. I feel fine now! We ate a nice HelloFresh dinner with pork and spaghetti. IDK if maybe that was it? I never really know.</p>
<p>I spent all day yesterday working on coloring my new Cousin sticker kit. I'm always spinning my wheels with color. I don't like for it to look too simple or garish but I also don't know when to stop either. I do my best! I need to make the little art deco for the boxes and then the art is mostly done.</p>
<p>Later... spent the day finalizing my new kit and did a test print-and-cut (it looks good!). I am mentally exhausted at the idea of writing a listing though, so maybe I should take it easy. The burnout is feeling super tangible right now. I really don't know how anyone runs a sticker shop successfully, all on their own. I am wiped out. Phew!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 20: What trend have you seen lately that you're tempted to try?</strong><br>
I'm pretty out of the loop on trends. I mostly consume &quot;planner&quot; content on social media. I have been wanting to use my Traveler's Notebook more even though I do zero traveling. Just as another journal. That's not really a trend though. I'm just super focused on shop work right now.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello Friday! Work was kind of a bummer yesterday. I don‚Äôt have room for anything so it‚Äôs not satisfying to finish up. It‚Äôs just technically ‚Äúdone‚Äù but not good in my eyes. It‚Äôs becoming very disheartening and I dunno how to turn my attitude about it around. It‚Äôs also just physically exhausting every single time. I think the satisfaction of having done a good job used to push me through. Now I just barely survive. And now I need to pivot to my shop today even though I‚Äôd love to just rest and recover. What‚Äôs that saying? Burning the candle at both ends. Yeah. That‚Äôs me lately.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 19: What‚Äôs a sound, flavor, or texture that grounds you?</strong><br>
I‚Äôve come to really love white noise. Always helps me fall asleep now. Even at work if there‚Äôs a heavy downpour of rain it sounds like white noise and it‚Äôs like I can breathe again. Ice cold water can be similar. Refreshing and like a little reset button on the senses. A strong cool breeze. Haha maybe if I just lived near a mountain waterfall I‚Äôd be grounded all the time?</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I spent all of yesterday designing a new sticker kit. I‚Äôm still finishing up the coloring portion. It has some really beautiful scenes but maybe a tiny bit too much detail? Idk, maybe just the right amount. It‚Äôs got strong winter vibes so I can‚Äôt procrastinate on this one! I‚Äôm excited to use it myself.</p>
<p>My troubled TikTok package finally got scanned into the system in Florida of all places. No place to scan it between Wisconsin and Florida?! At least it‚Äôs finally in there.</p>
<p>They should be finishing up the pavement repairs today but my van is parked one street over so I‚Äôll have to walk a little to get to it. I repeat: Summer go away, you are no longer welcome here. I want fall!</p>
<p>This ink is too light on this paper.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 8: What is your current favorite little luxury?</strong><br>
The thing I splurge on most often is stickers. It‚Äôs a small thing that is just designed to make planning and journaling more fun. I get to find visuals that match my inner feelings.<br>
It really has helped so much in the past year too that I‚Äôve been consistently journaling. I know my ADHD brain would get bored if it was all text and no fun art. I am so much more organized in my thoughts now. But yes it is a luxury because it‚Äôs not required for living‚Äîjust really nice to have.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Not sure if this ink is dark enough to be considered easily legible but I filled my new pen with it, so we‚Äôre stuck for awhile. My final order from Boston General Store arrived yesterday and I got myself a treat: a TWSBI Eco with a fine nib in Espresso Bronze. It‚Äôs very pretty! And now I‚Äôm all set with my planners for 2026.</p>
<p>Today they are sealing cracks in the pavement so I had to move my van to a different street. I used to have divots in the pavement where I always parked but they filled those in yesterday.</p>
<p>I think I‚Äôll do some design work for the shop today since I‚Äôm basically stuck at home. I think I should make another weekly kit. It would be nice to have more than 2 in the shop. But they take awhile so IDK how far I‚Äôll get today.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>If you had a shop mascot, what would it be and what would they do all day?</strong><br>
Well I guess this question only makes sense for shop owners. Maybe a chicken? Running around all day, feeling scattered and overwhelmed, haha. At least lately. I feel pulled in a million directions but I‚Äôm spending my time wisely... but also, I do have Cookie, my actual shop mascot. A chocolate chip cookie with a bite taken out. Sweet but has been through some stuff. Also a good analogy for myself at times!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Wow I should NOT have had that hot dog for dinner last night. Tummy troubles for real! Ugh. Was also just wiped after work yesterday so it was a double whammy. Hopefully today isn‚Äôt nearly so exhausting. But also why is it the middle of summer heat again? I‚Äôve seen leaves changing on trees‚Äîthis can‚Äôt happen. I do NOT approve. Our fall preview was so beautiful and lovely.</p>
<p>Anyways‚ÄîI have nothing but trouble with my TikTok Shop. Everything had been fine for a few months but now my local post office is back to not scanning my outgoing packages so the system thinks I‚Äôm not sending things out when I 100% am. I‚Äôll have to walk in and get a receipt for every package again. Super annoying and time consuming. You never know how slow the line will be. Why don‚Äôt they just scan all mail from the mailboxes? I do not get it at all.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 16: What‚Äôs your personal definition of ‚Äúproductive‚Äù right now?</strong><br>
Probably not a very balanced idea of it right now. I feel like I want to be designing new sticker sheets everyday and keeping up with production and orders and social media all at the same time. Conceptually I understand that it‚Äôs productive to rest and rejuvenate but I don‚Äôt always allow that reality. It should be just that I try each day and do what I can.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs a new week. I took Saturday and Sunday off from shop stuff. I‚Äôm feeling more fresh mentally but I am a little worried I broke my momentum. I only have one order to mail today. Maybe it‚Äôs unrelated but who knows! I need to pick up some groceries after work today. It should be a normal day, nothing exciting in the forecast.</p>
<p>Although my order from Boston General Store might arrive. It said last Friday but it got delayed so now it says today. There‚Äôs no rush but it would be nice to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù my 2026 Hobonichi haul.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 15: What seasonal trend are you irrationally excited (or annoyed) about?</strong><br>
Maybe this makes me a cranky old person but I‚Äôm not into trick or treating. I don‚Äôt want to hand out candy to a bunch of strangers who come to my house. I enjoyed doing it as a kid ‚Äî trick or treating ‚Äî but the adult portion is not fun for me. It‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm a bit of a hermit, and my home is my sanctuary away from the world of people. It‚Äôs just not my thing. M. always hands out the candy anyway. I‚Äôll just put out the candy bowl if I ever have to one day. Sorry kids, I‚Äôd rather be you!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Taking care of all the routine weekly chores today. I decided to take yesterday off from work.</p>
<p>Played a game on my Switch called <em>Escape from Mystwood Mansion</em>. I finished it‚Äîbut forgot one thing so it was totally unsatisfying. Whoops! Also all the puzzles felt inconsistent‚Äîdid 75% of them were fine but the others were too hard or just super complicated. It just felt like not the most professionally made game. Could have used more testing I think. 3.5 of 5 stars.</p>
<p>It was a nice change of pace from all the work though. Hopefully my brain appreciated the break!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 14: What's something cozy you wish was socially acceptable year-round?</strong><br>
It‚Äôs not unacceptable but hoodies and hot chocolate. Those things just don‚Äôt mesh well with summer heat. But both are cozy vibes! It might be less special and cozy if it was done all year round though. I do kind of wish I was one of those people who‚Äôs cold all the time so I could wear hoodies and sweaters all year long‚Äîbut I‚Äôm the opposite.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>M. got me donuts for breakfast! Yummy! Haven‚Äôt done that in forever. I finished watching season 2 of <em>The Lazarus Project</em> last night. It‚Äôs a good show. If there is another season, I know I‚Äôm going to have to rewatch this one though. Time travel makes for a confusing plot!</p>
<p>Yesterday was very productive, so I don‚Äôt know what I should do today. More work? Or more chill? I‚Äôm not very good at gauging how much energy I‚Äôm going to have on any given day. I guess I just fly by the seat of my pants most days.</p>
<p>I think I‚Äôve already released 4 new sticker sheets just this month so far. Maybe it should be an ‚Äúoff‚Äù day to recharge.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 13: What household chore do you secretly enjoy more than you admit?</strong><br>
Not sure it‚Äôs a secret but laundry! I love having my dresser and closet fully stocked at the end of the week. I feel more prepared for anything that might happen that week. Even if I have to do something last minute I can do it in my favorite jeans or whatever. It‚Äôs that small sense of control and a full reset for the new week.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello Friday</p>
<p>Kind of an open day to do whatever I feel like. Not sure which tasks to prioritize today. I‚Äôve been meaning to write a newsletter for the shop, I could do that. I could finalize a Deco sheet I started. Or I could start a totally new design. Hmm‚Ä¶ not sure what would be best. Maybe finishing my deco sheet for a quick-ish win? It didn‚Äôt cut through last time and I have zero idea why. All the settings were the same as ever. New blade and pretty new sticky mat.</p>
<p>Oh I finished another jigsaw puzzle last night. I have 3 I‚Äôd like to glue together now. I just hate the smell of the glue so I also procrastinate that task. I think my 2nd part of my Hobonichi order should arrive today. Yay! I‚Äôll have everything I need.</p>
<p>Later‚Ä¶ worked on shop stuff. I figured out why my cuts were messed up‚Äîa tiny scrap of sticker paper got stuck to the blade. It was cutting most lines but not all the way. So I added a few imperfects/seconds for a discount to my Etsy. Then finished the Winter Floral deco and got it listed. Even got more inventory up to better levels and figured out my 2nd machine just needed a new cutting mat. So I was able to do a lot! Yay!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello Thursday! It was nice to take a little break from shop work yesterday. I do need to remember to balance rejuvenation with hard work‚Äîeven during busy seasons. It‚Äôs such a weird concept to feel pulled to do work but to not always follow through. Because in the end that‚Äôs the most sustainable path. I suppose with normal jobs where you work with and for other people you don‚Äôt get any choice. If they want to try to overwork you, they can. But there is also a ‚Äúshared workload‚Äù to help offset some overwhelm.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs just an interesting gig being your own boss. And being a team of one person. I‚Äôm sure there isn‚Äôt one ‚Äúright‚Äù way to do it. But I should enforce more balance when I can. Particularly with a creative/art business.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 11: What snack is wildly seasonal for you and why?</strong><br>
Very specifically a 3 Musketeers candy bar. It‚Äôs only for Halloween and literally no other time of the year. Maybe hot chocolate for winter, pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. I think they‚Äôre just so seasonal because that‚Äôs when I first and subsequently had them the most. It‚Äôs not that they belong to specific times, it‚Äôs just too weird otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>free day</strong> ‚Äî Time to choose how to spend it‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Options, options. I‚Äôm considering a beach day but I‚Äôm also on a roll with designing new products for the shop. Trying to avoid the dreaded burnout. Oh and my 2026 Hobonichi order from Atlas Stationers is out for delivery! Yay!</p>
<p>If it arrives soon I could film a lil haul for social media. Or set up pens in it‚Ä¶ or stare at it! My other order isn‚Äôt supposed to arrive until Friday though. It‚Äôs just 3 items from the Tsuki no Iro collection (the index stickers, dot stickers, and add on sticky notes). But no way to know if it will be here soon or not.</p>
<p>I think I‚Äôll do the beach‚Äîshop stuff always waits.</p>
<p>Later‚Ä¶ The beach was cloudy and the waves were tiny so it felt very peaceful and quiet. Then when I got home my 2026 Hobonichi order had arrived! Yay! I have Wave Ave and Foggy Plaid Weeks for next year. Very happy to see them in person and know I‚Äôll have them to use when the time comes.</p>

<p>Hello Tuesday! I used my new face moisturizer last night and my skin is not happy. My face feels hurt today. I patch tested on my hand and no reaction. It might go away as my face gets used to it but I‚Äôm just grumpy they raised the price on my fave moisturizer sooo much. Us sensitive skin girlies can‚Äôt take the changes! I miss my old face wash by Eucerin too. I try my best to find similar ingredients but it‚Äôs hopeless. There‚Äôs just too many products to choose from! Maybe I should have looked for the cheap one from Trader Joe‚Äôs before buying the $25 stuff on Amazon. I don‚Äôt have the patience to do a Sephora sample run. Also it‚Äôs all pretty pricey there. This could all also be because of the changing humidity too‚Ä¶ ugh.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 9: What‚Äôs something you hoard even though you barely use it?</strong><br>
Oof! Probably a few things. Computers probably. They cost so much when you buy them that it‚Äôs hard to let them go. Plus they have whole chunks of my life on them. And I love a random tech hobby every couple of years. Maybe shoes too. I love having the right pair for the exact weather/outfit. I‚Äôm always trying to balance my own comfort with style. Same with some of my clothes too. Probably because I‚Äôm very sensory sensitive.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello Sunday! Whoa I got a lot of new orders last night. I guess the algorithms like it when you add new products to the shop. I have 6 already and the day is young. I‚Äôve seen some people already have their 2026 Hobonichi planners on social media. My order from Atlas Stationers still hasn‚Äôt been fulfilled but I know that their shipment arrived so they‚Äôre working on it.</p>
<p>Later‚Ä¶ I spent the day filling orders and restocking sticker inventory. I maybe pushed it today with work because I tried to cut more after dinner but I screwed up the first few sheets. It‚Äôs frustrating how different my brain works in the evening. I wish I could get more done. I‚Äôm getting concerned about my ability to keep up this year. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to or not.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 7: What weird or oddly specific smell makes you feel nostalgic?</strong><br>
Crayons or Elmer‚Äôs Glue. Instant childhood memories. That crayon wax smell is literally only crayons. Candle wax isn‚Äôt the same. A fresh box of crayons is just a highly specific thing for me. And yes I pronounce it like ‚Äúcran‚Äù‚Äîsue me.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello Saturday! I have four orders to mail today. People are starting to buy their 2026 calendars so I think sticker season is beginning.</p>
<p>I refilled my printer ink for stickers yesterday, which is the first time I‚Äôve had to do that since I got it. Good to know the ink lasts a long time. I want to write and photograph yesterday‚Äôs Thanksgiving sticker sheet so that‚Äôs totally done. I also need to re-ink this pen‚Ä¶  (Running out of ink!)</p>
<p>Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Halloween are all live now in the shop! Cookie‚Äôs collection is starting to feel a lot more complete. I‚Äôm so proud of myself for keeping up with an idea I believe in. My little Cookie character has had a bite taken out of them but they keep their spirits high!</p>
<p>I kind of want to make another zine now for Cookie to be featured in, but that‚Äôs not high on the seasonal importance list. Tomorrow will be either an off day for me or just restocking. Two sheets in two days from sketch to live is a LOT on my brain. Really, really happy to have some seasonal offerings this year though. Tired brain and all. Haha!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Free day ‚Äì what should I do?</p>
<p>Hello Friday! I‚Äôm torn between a long walk at the beach or a big design day for the shop. Good weather is so hard to come by but an entirely free day to dig in deep to design is  too! I‚Äôm leaning toward shop work day because I want to get seasonal stuff in the shop ASAP. I could always go out tomorrow or Sunday. Then it would be like a reward for getting some work done! I‚Äôll start with some Thanksgiving art and see how much I can get done with that. Then maybe Christmas? I can only dream of getting that far. We‚Äôll see.</p>
<p>Later‚Ä¶ I got a sticker sheet designed for Thanksgiving. Just have the listings and photos to do before those can go live. Very happy that‚Äôs done! My Cookie character is celebrating all the holidays lately. Haha! Maybe Christmas is next.</p>
<p>I ran out of my facial moisturizer today so went to re-order and they raised the price by over $20! It was already a semi-luxurious purchase before but now I can‚Äôt justify the cost. That‚Äôs just INSANE. I‚Äôve been using it for years and my skin loves it. I have to fall down another skincare rabbit hole to find a replacement with all the right ingredients. Ugh.</p>

<h2>Word</h2>
<p><strong>abeyance</strong> <em>(noun)</em></p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The legal case is now being held in abeyance while the parties attempt to find a mutually acceptable solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note: If I have heard this word before I didn‚Äôt know what it meant. Love a totally new to me word of the day.</em></p>
<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs a bit weird to be going back to my day job again so soon. But Labor Day makes my week weird. It doesn‚Äôt give me a day off‚Äîjust pushes my work day later. Oh well. At least I was able to do all my monthly work on the 1st of the month and be done with it.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs going to be so nice and cool out today. I‚Äôm loving these extended fall weather previews so much. We had rain yesterday and I wasn‚Äôt even mad‚Äîjust happy the worst of summer is over.</p>
<p>Yesterday I hoped to do some design work but I just felt braindead. No extra juice in the tank. I was disappointed but I try to listen to my body when it tells me to rest, so I just relaxed. Hopefully this weekend will be a good one for new designs!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 4: What‚Äôs a recent impulse you gave into with zero regrets?</strong><br>
Quite literally I got the random craving for an Oreo today. So I bought some after work and had a few after dinner. No regrets. I rarely eat Oreos anyway, so it was one of those odd things that you might as well just have fun with anyway. At least I for reasonable, non-dangerous/overly indulgent items!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Got my hair trimmed today! It needed it. Also got a coupon for $10 off next time. I need to remember to use that! It was pouring rain right before I left the house but when I got out there, there wasn‚Äôt even a drop. Had to keep switching my windshield wipers all the way to the salon. Wacky! Oh and the Halloween store is open already! Too soon! I‚Äôm okay with autumn stuff but Halloween is still almost two months away!</p>
<p>Later: I don‚Äôt really know why but my creative brain was not functioning today. I had a big burst towards the end of August with lots of highly focused energy days, so this must be the brain‚Äôs way of rebalancing things out. Just a day to watch the second part of &quot;Wednesday&quot; on Netflix and put together a jigsaw puzzle I started yesterday. Back to work tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 3: What‚Äôs the most ridiculous fall-themed product you secretly love?</strong><br>
I don‚Äôt know that I fall for any seasonal hype products‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt love coffee so I don‚Äôt get the pumpkin spice latte. I‚Äôm not really a seasonal food person either. I guess I kind of wanted apple cider but that‚Äôs not ridiculous or secret. I‚Äôm just not secretive with anything.</p>
