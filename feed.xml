<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Happy September Equinox!<br>
Fall starts today but our weather hasn’t gotten the memo. I have 6 orders to fill today—woot woot. I got bit by a fall fashion shopping bug last night. It always happens around my birthday because it’s the only season I really enjoy shopping for clothes. Sweaters and jackets! Boots and bags! Summer is the worst—I always feel too exposed and when it’s humid I just want to wear whatever absorbs sweat the best LOL.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 22: What’s a recent comment or message that made you smile?</strong><br>
I was at work last week lugging buckets of water around—being grumpy about it. And someone saw me and said “I like your hair!” It snapped me totally out of it and made me smile. It felt really genuine. Ever since I switched to my natural waves a year or two ago, no one really comments anymore (which makes sense because it doesn’t change). But it was nice to hear from a stranger and broke my stormy mood for the moment.</p>
<p>I wish I was better about complimenting other people. I get scared I’ll get stuck in a whole awkward conversation if I open the door so I always chicken out unless I know someone really well already. Introverting is hard like that. I never know when to push myself out of my comfort zone. Will I regret it, or will it be a kind/awesome thing?</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>It’s the last official day of summer! I’m ready for it to go. It was a very slow morning. No reason but I was just sleepy and cozy in bed. I’ve been working hard lately so I’m saying it’s okay if today is just chill.</p>
<p>Last night my brain rapidly melted down. Not 100%, but borderline existential crisis mode. I just have an order that went missing but it was marked delivered. So I can’t file an insurance claim or even a missing mail search. It just makes me sad that I can’t control the entire process and it costs me—despite doing all the “right” things to protect my orders.</p>
<p>So I was just questioning my life decision to run my own business and all the stress that means for me. I just wonder sometimes if working for someone else would make me feel more secure. Ultimately I still believe my shop is absolutely the best choice for me, but there are doubts. And I don’t have any business partner to talk me through it so I need to give myself the pep talk.</p>
<p>The grind is a real thing and stickers are a brutal business. The amount of SKUs required to stay relevant is a bit wild for one person. And maybe it never makes any profit. At least people are connecting with my art. That’s a rare and special thing!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Not sure why but my stomach woke me up at 5:30am and I did not feel well at all. Yuck! I eventually got back to sleep but it was not a fun night. I feel fine now! We ate a nice HelloFresh dinner with pork and spaghetti. IDK if maybe that was it? I never really know.</p>
<p>I spent all day yesterday working on coloring my new Cousin sticker kit. I'm always spinning my wheels with color. I don't like for it to look too simple or garish but I also don't know when to stop either. I do my best! I need to make the little art deco for the boxes and then the art is mostly done.</p>
<p>Later... spent the day finalizing my new kit and did a test print-and-cut (it looks good!). I am mentally exhausted at the idea of writing a listing though, so maybe I should take it easy. The burnout is feeling super tangible right now. I really don't know how anyone runs a sticker shop successfully, all on their own. I am wiped out. Phew!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 20: What trend have you seen lately that you're tempted to try?</strong><br>
I'm pretty out of the loop on trends. I mostly consume &quot;planner&quot; content on social media. I have been wanting to use my Traveler's Notebook more even though I do zero traveling. Just as another journal. That's not really a trend though. I'm just super focused on shop work right now.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello Friday! Work was kind of a bummer yesterday. I don’t have room for anything so it’s not satisfying to finish up. It’s just technically “done” but not good in my eyes. It’s becoming very disheartening and I dunno how to turn my attitude about it around. It’s also just physically exhausting every single time. I think the satisfaction of having done a good job used to push me through. Now I just barely survive. And now I need to pivot to my shop today even though I’d love to just rest and recover. What’s that saying? Burning the candle at both ends. Yeah. That’s me lately.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 19: What’s a sound, flavor, or texture that grounds you?</strong><br>
I’ve come to really love white noise. Always helps me fall asleep now. Even at work if there’s a heavy downpour of rain it sounds like white noise and it’s like I can breathe again. Ice cold water can be similar. Refreshing and like a little reset button on the senses. A strong cool breeze. Haha maybe if I just lived near a mountain waterfall I’d be grounded all the time?</p>

<p>I spent all of yesterday designing a new sticker kit. I’m still finishing up the coloring portion. It has some really beautiful scenes but maybe a tiny bit too much detail?

<p>Not sure if this ink is dark enough to be considered easily legible but I filled my new pen with it, so we’re stuck for awhile.

<p>I think I’ll do some design work for the shop today since I’m basically stuck at home. I think I should make another weekly kit. It would be nice to have more than 2 in the shop. But they take awhile so IDK how far I’ll get today.</p>

<p><strong>If you had a shop mascot, what would it be and what would they do all day?</strong><br>
Well I guess this question only makes sense for shop owners. Maybe a chicken? Running around all day, feeling scattered and overwhelmed, haha. At least lately. I feel pulled in a million directions but I’m spending my time wisely... but also, I do have Cookie, my actual shop mascot. A chocolate chip cookie with a bite taken out. Sweet but has been through some stuff. Also a good analogy for myself at times!</p>

<p>Wow I should NOT have had that hot dog for dinner last night. Tummy troubles for real! Ugh. Was also just wiped after work yesterday so it was a double whammy. Hopefully today isn’t nearly so exhausting. But also why is it the middle of summer heat again? I’ve seen leaves changing on trees—this can’t happen. I do NOT approve. Our fall preview was so beautiful and lovely.</p>
<p>Anyways—I have nothing but trouble with my TikTok Shop. Everything had been fine for a few months but now my local post office is back to not scanning my outgoing packages so the system thinks I’m not sending things out when I 100% am. I’ll have to walk in and get a receipt for every package again. Super annoying and time consuming. You never know how slow the line will be. Why don’t they just scan all mail from the mailboxes?

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Taking care of all the routine weekly chores today. I decided to take yesterday off from work.</p>
<p>Played a game on my Switch called <em>Escape from Mystwood Mansion</em>. I finished it—but forgot one thing so it was totally unsatisfying. Whoops! Also all the puzzles felt inconsistent—did 75% of them were fine but the others were too hard or just super complicated. It just felt like not the most professionally made game. Could have used more testing I think. 3.5 of 5 stars.</p>
<p>It was a nice change of pace from all the work though. Hopefully my brain appreciated the break!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 14: What's something cozy you wish was socially acceptable year-round?</strong><br>
It’s not unacceptable but hoodies and hot chocolate. Those things just don’t mesh well with summer heat. But both are cozy vibes! It might be less special and cozy if it was done all year round though. I do kind of wish I was one of those people who’s cold all the time so I could wear hoodies and sweaters all year long—but I’m the opposite.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Taking care of all the routine weekly chores today. I decided to take yesterday off from work.</p>
<p>Played a game on my Switch called <em>Escape from Mystwood Mansion</em>. I finished it—but forgot one thing so it was totally unsatisfying. Whoops! Also all the puzzles felt inconsistent—did 75% of them were fine but the others were too hard or just super complicated. It just felt like not the most professionally made game. Could have used more testing I think. 3.5 of 5 stars.</p>
<p>It was a nice change of pace from all the work though. Hopefully my brain appreciated the break!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 14: What's something cozy you wish was socially acceptable year-round?</strong><br>
It’s not unacceptable but hoodies and hot chocolate. Those things just don’t mesh well with summer heat. But both are cozy vibes! It might be less special and cozy if it was done all year round though. I do kind of wish I was one of those people who’s cold all the time so I could wear hoodies and sweaters all year long—but I’m the opposite.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>M. got me donuts for breakfast! Yummy! Haven’t done that in forever. I finished watching season 2 of <em>The Lazarus Project</em> last night. It’s a good show. If there is another season, I know I’m going to have to rewatch this one though. Time travel makes for a confusing plot!</p>
<p>Yesterday was very productive, so I don’t know what I should do today. More work? Or more chill? I’m not very good at gauging how much energy I’m going to have on any given day. I guess I just fly by the seat of my pants most days.</p>
<p>I think I’ve already released 4 new sticker sheets just this month so far. Maybe it should be an “off” day to recharge.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 13: What household chore do you secretly enjoy more than you admit?</strong><br>
Not sure it’s a secret but laundry! I love having my dresser and closet fully stocked at the end of the week. I feel more prepared for anything that might happen that week. Even if I have to do something last minute I can do it in my favorite jeans or whatever. It’s that small sense of control and a full reset for the new week.</p>
