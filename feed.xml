<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I have off work this Thursday due to my dentist appointment getting rescheduled so yesterday was my only day this week. Woo! I think I'll work on a Halloween sticker sheet and get that finished this week. I got my biggest order of sticker paper yesterday. I believe this shop is going to pick up steam, so I’m increasing how much I keep in stock. Should make the busy season a little easier on me. I hope. I need to finish listing the 2026 calendars too, stalled out at the photography phase.</p>
<p><strong>Later</strong> — Okay, I took some photos and listed them on my website… only to realize I didn’t actually cut any inventory for 2 of 3 sizes. Wow brain! Whoops. So I cut some and I’ll finish the rest tomorrow. I swear I’m running on brain fumes lately. I kind of wish I could take a month off for a sort of resting vacation. I’ll do okay for a day or two, and then my energy just completely tanks out. I hope I don’t go full burnout mode. I’m trying to pace myself but doing it all alone just means stuff HAS to get done whether I have energy for it or not. Running a whole business requires a constant shifting of roles and usually that’s what makes it fun for me. But when I’m tired it just means all areas can suffer equally.</p>

<h2>Word</h2>
<p><strong>ostentatious</strong> <em>(adj.)</em></p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn’t get back to sleep for an hour. Those types of nights totally ruin my mood. I hate wondering: will I get back to sleep or will I just lay here doing nothing until morning comes? It’s probably largely because I ate a brownie after dinner. Too indulgent and my stomach said no. But when life offers you a brownie you gotta take it! lol.</p>
<p>Anyways I did take it easy yesterday but ended up with a headache anyway. I drew 3 stickers and then I told myself to stop so I could rest. I guess that was too much. Me and my body lately… can’t just get along I guess.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 18: What’s your go-to response when someone asks, “How’s it going?”</strong><br>
Easy? “I’m good! How are you?” Sometimes I’ll throw in something about the weather: “Sure is hot out there.” As a neurodivergent human, it’s pretty normal to script answers like this. I try to change it slightly if I know someone a little better. But often people aren’t actually curious about your life and they are just being polite — a quick answer is sufficient and even preferred to a totally honest one.</p>
<h2>📌 Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Great sleep</strong> (8h 24m)</li>
<li>✅ <strong>All habits completed</strong></li>
<li>✅ <strong>All tasks completed</strong></li>

<p>Yesterday was surprisingly productive. I’m going to take it easy today. I really had 3 really focused days in a row. Which is very unusual for me. Maybe I’m getting excited because Hobonichi reveals their 2026 planners every day on social media. So I’m thinking about the future!

<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 17: What’s the most recent piece of advice you’ve completely ignored?</strong><br>
Kind of hard to think of any. If I feel like certain advice isn’t right for me, I think I just mentally trash it after I hear it. Otherwise I just feel guilty. I guess I heard that if you have pale skin you should really be getting your skin checked regularly with a dermatologist. I’m still planning to make an appointment but I just don’t know logistically how to make the appointment and make sure it’s covered by insurance. So I’m procrastinated because ADHD makes it feel like too many steps. So it’s advice I will eventually get to but for now it’s getting ignored.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Yesterday was a good day. I hadn’t planned on designing 3 whole sticker sheets but it worked out. I’m still stuck, unable to use Adobe Illustrator when I’m cutting stickers but the calendars get started in Affinity Publisher so I could actually do design and cutting at the same time. Like I used to be able to. I really, really need a laptop so I can overcome that software glitch in the future.  It’s incredibly slowing to my whole work process. I cannot believe they haven’t fixed it yet either. I might have to figure out a stopgap workflow in Affinity Designer for awhile. I just don’t know if it has all the path tools I need like offset, simplify, smooth, etc.<br>
Very HIGH energy and productive day!</p>
<p>TCMC subscription arrived and I organized my whole sticker collection in binders. Yay!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 16: If you were a candle scent, what would be in your blend?</strong><br>
Well, I think I’d mostly have something sweet like vanilla. I’m generally a kind/sweet person with a big heart. Maybe some cinnamon for my neurospicy nature. I lean towards intensity when I do have emotions tho so maybe a hint of something stronger. I’m no fragrance expert. Maybe amber for the drama and some complexity.</p>

<p>Spent the day working on stuff for the shop. Got to work right away restocking low products. Then I was thinking about my next product and remembered I need to make 2026 calendar stickers for the Hobonichi planners. Took me awhile to remember how I did it last year so I documented the process this time in my Obsidian notes. Should be pretty quick from here on out. I’m just proofing them now and I should be able to get them listed this weekend. Yay! I still need to keep restocking lots of staple items and stuff some more envelopes for Q3 when I get a chance.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 15: What’s your most-used emoji, and does it fit your actual personality?</strong><br>
Mine is the blushing, smiling emoji surrounded by 3 little hearts. I think it fits me well because I do feel that way a lot. It’s like the “awww” emoji to me. I find a lot of things cute or adorable or I’m thankful in that way. I’m glad it wasn’t an LOL emoji cuz I rarely laugh that hard like that.</p>

<p>Man my sleep has been so inconsistent lately. Very strange. Anyway, today is a work day. Next week I had to reschedule my dentist appt to Thursday because they didn’t have any other days. I also got some sticker sheets cut yesterday. Somehow I oversold by 1 so I had to restock ASAP. I’m always super diligent with my inventory tracking so I don’t know what happened. I’m gonna blame the tools. Not human error. Ha!! Probably, actually my fault somewhere. I wonder if other shop owners under list their inventory by 1–10 or something so they don’t oversell?

Won’t be a very nutritious day but I’d pick M. I could have a muffin for breakfast, macaroni and cheese for dinner. I don’t know what my snacks/lunch would be tough. Uh… mozzarella string cheese? Oh I could make something mini: like a mini quiche or something. And maybe some milk chocolate or a Mr. Goodbar if I’m craving dessert. IDK this is a HARD question!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I'm changing my daily habit from social media post to self-care. I'm pretty burnt out on social media so it's just not going to be a daily priority for me anymore. I'd rather work directly on my business designing new products. Those will last and add value for a lot longer than anything I put on social media anyway.</p>
<p>Last night it took me hours to fall asleep. My dental cleaning got cancelled so I think I had saved up energy for that. Then it had nowhere to go. So—insomnia. Not all that surprising, but frustrating anyway. Maybe I'll cut a few sticker sheets to feel productive today, or work on my special app thing for Hobonichi planners. Not sure yet, but coding does seem to have my heart lately.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 13: What's your current &quot;comfort rewatch&quot; TV show, movie, or YT channel?</strong><br>
Right now I'm watching &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; but I don't know how far I'll get. It's not an ultimate favorite, but it reminds me of nostalgic fashion and high school drama. I watch old TCMC videos from Helen if I want something cozy and very chill. A classic rewatch is &quot;Supernatural&quot; for me. I've watched it many times!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Phew no major rainfall last night. Just a short storm. Hopefully it didn’t make the flooding much worse. My aunt went to the Falls and apparently it stinks so bad they didn’t stop to look. How sad! And I’ve seen countless people wading into it with their kids to play. Oh the bacteria of it all. Do they not watch the news or what? M. says the lake has receded a bit overnight so that’s good. We got sooo lucky. I’m so grateful. I may have lost a little sleep but not having to gut our basement or be trapped in our neighborhood is a wonderful blessing. Hopefully none of the roads I take to work got flooded!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 11: What's your most irrational fear that you know is silly, but still have?</strong><br>
No origin story but I’m terrified of walking behind people fishing. I have a fear that they’ll swing back their pole to get the line out and it will instead catch on my face and hook me. It’s such a specific thing… maybe I had a nightmare like that or something. I just do NOT want to walk near anyone that’s fishing at all.</p>
<p>Much later: Let’s all just agree that Bachelor in Paradise is a ridiculous show. I don’t know why hate-watching something feels so cathartic though?</p>

It’s such a specific thing… maybe I had a nightmare like that or something. I just do NOT want to walk near anyone that’s fishing at all.</p>
<p>Much later: Let’s all just agree that Bachelor in Paradise is a ridiculous show. I don’t know why hate-watching something feels so cathartic though?</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Wow last night we got over 10 inches of rain. The thunder was so loud I couldn’t fall asleep. Then around 3 a.m. our basement water alarms went off. Went to check it out and the sump pump was full. There was water leaking in from the walls and up from a crack in the floor (that I don’t think was there before). I’ve never seen anything like it. There wasn’t much to do. We turned the sump pump off and on again and it started to work again. So it was hard to settle down for sleep after that but I eventually did! Our rivers are like 2 feet higher than ever in recorded history. I’m so glad it didn’t get worse in our basement! Lots of power outages but we kept ours. I’m sure the basement would have totally flooded without the sump pump. I wonder how our neighbors did?</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 10: If your day today was a playlist, what would be the first 3 songs?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Set Fire to the Rain — Adele</li>
<li>Dog Days Are Over — Florence + the Machine</li>
<li>Up All Night — Owl City (’Cuz floods and rain and I’m tired.)</li>
</ol>
