<h2>Word</h2>
<p><strong>incisive</strong> <em>(adj.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>impressively direct and decisive; it is generally applied to something communicated in a way that is very clear and direct, or to a person who is able to explain difficult ideas clearly and confidently.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The columnist is known for her incisive commentary on local politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Not sure if I‚Äôve ever heard this word!</em> Well it feels like I have but I didn't really get the meaning.</p>
<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm going to try to have the most mosquito-bite-free outdoor experience possible today during PEAK mosquito season. I‚Äôm going to try to keep long sleeves/pants, I‚Äôll use my Picaridin lotion, and I‚Äôm going to a sandy beach which hopefully means wind. Maximal comfort strategy engaged. I‚Äôll probably focus more on the walk aspect than any rock hunting if the bugs are noticeably bad. At least a little outdoor time is better than none. I‚Äôll report back on the excursion later!</p>
<p>Report: Not one. Single. Bug. Yay! IDK if it was the clothing or bug spray or the wind but it was my most perfect outdoor day. The waves were up really high so all the rocks were underwater (well, the good ones at least!) but I didn‚Äôt mind. I did get a tiny blister on my pinkie toe because I wore my sandals when they were wet. But in my defense that was because last time I walked barefoot I got bruises on the bottom of my feet so I was trying to prevent that. It‚Äôs dangerous out there!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I wanted/needed to get a lot of work for the business done yesterday but I just got technical issues instead. I‚Äôm still annoyed about it. But some important stuff did get finished so it wasn‚Äôt a total loss.</p>
<p>I sold my first Halloween Cookie sheet and my Colored Holidays sheet. That always feels great. It‚Äôs like a proof of concept that yes, that work you did was indeed worth it to at least one person.</p>
<p>I have the weirdest pain on my tongue. I noticed it yesterday but it kept getting worse into the evening. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs from the dentist last week or if I bit it in my sleep somehow? It‚Äôs making it kind of hard to chew and talk. Usually mouth stuff heals super fast though so I hope it just goes away on its own. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much medicine that‚Äôs useful here.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 28: Which everyday object would you enchant to have magical powers?</strong><br>
Car ‚Üí teleports.<br>
Bed ‚Üí has a sleep on switch, for instantly falling asleep.<br>
Bathtub ‚Üí automatically cleans me and washes my hair and all that.<br>
Closet ‚Üí adjusts all clothing to a perfect fit for me.<br>
I can't pick just one!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I'm having a hard time trying to decide what Hobonichi planners to get for 2026. I know I need the A5 Avec‚Äîthat‚Äôs my daily darling. But if I design stickers for the other sizes I want something to test them in. I like to see something tangible before I release it. I do have empty pages from my 2025 A6 and Weeks but I feel weird combining tests with real planning for some reason? IDK. It‚Äôs just expensive too. I‚Äôm trying to save up for a laptop this year and I just don‚Äôt know how to decide. I used my A6 + Weeks very sporadically/randomly. The A6 was more mental health/personal but I find it hard to write in at that size. I don‚Äôt do small well. I try not to feel guilty for empty pages but with money being a lot tighter I‚Äôm trying to be careful.</p>
<p>Later: Today was kind of frustrating really. My main cut machine malfunctioned and I spent over an hour troubleshooting. And my 2nd machine did fail later in the evening too. On a day I was finding work a bit overwhelming before any of that happened. Just nothing to say other than: annoyed. At least I got all of the September journaling prompts done and posted everywhere. Just a mixed bag of a day. Tried my best.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I watched a random YouTube video last night from Wired (I think) where they asked a teacher a bunch of questions. She had the best energy and attitude ever. I actually teared up because she seemed so awesome and caring. But then I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep because it brought up so many emotions.</p>
<p>The public school system failed me. It‚Äôs always hard for me to think about high school particularly. So my mind just couldn‚Äôt quiet down for sleep. My heart aches for any child who doesn‚Äôt fit perfectly into that system (or just can‚Äôt find a way to make it work).</p>
<p>I wish all teachers could be empathetic and flexible with all the unique types of students. She said something I loved: ‚ÄúEvery student is in their own right place at the right time.‚Äù Like if someone learns ‚Äúfaster‚Äù or ‚Äúslower,‚Äù it‚Äôs all okay‚Äîthat‚Äôs just their pace. How silly is it that just because you‚Äôre at a certain age you‚Äôre all supposed to know the exact same stuff.</p>
<p>Life happens. I wish teachers had more resources and more influence over customizing their teaching for all the types of kids they teach. It just brought up so many emotions. I wish I could have thrived more in school. I wish every child had an amazing teacher who was kind and compassionate to them. I wish emotional skills and kindness were part of every education.</p>
<p>I wish. I wish. Kids deserve better than a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Another perfect weather day today. But it‚Äôs a workday, so I‚Äôll be stuck inside for most of it. Oh well! This whole week is going to be cooler than average, so I‚Äôll just embrace it when I can. I can‚Äôt believe August is already ending this week. I‚Äôll have all my normal accounting/spreadsheets to fill out. I also need to finish the September journaling prompts. I really liked August‚Äôs. They were fun but also made you think. It was a good vibe.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning our furnace is getting its annual servicing. Hopefully the temp stays cool so running the furnace doesn‚Äôt warm me up. Hah!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 25: What‚Äôs the most ‚Äúyou‚Äù thing you‚Äôve done this month?</strong><br>
Easy. I started a large crochet project. Made a lot of fast initial progress‚Ä¶ and then when the task felt slightly overwhelming and slow, I halted completely. The dopamine just wasn‚Äôt hitting. Sooo‚Ä¶ my poor Mushroom Guy plushie has a head and 2/3 of a body but now has just been abandoned for an unknown amount of time. CLASSIC ME!</p>
<p>I have my place marked and all the instructions are marked too. So at any point I can pick it up again. It‚Äôs just the most ‚Äúme‚Äù thing ever. I‚Äôm a super strong starter of projects. Finishing is not my specialty, however. At least I try new things and get joy from the parts I do!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt too hot to function outside today! Yay!! I went for a walk with M. at a local park. The sun was warm, and there was a nice breeze. We did get attacked by mosquitos in some parts though, which was awful. Totally ruins the peaceful nature vibe. I hate them so much. I may stick to beach-only outdoor trips until we get a first frost here. The flooding probably made them a lot worse. Also there‚Äôs still a huge pile of flooding trash in our whole neighborhood. But we got an email that everything was picked up. That‚Äôs going to be a problem!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 24: Which fictional universe would you happily retire in?</strong><br>
I‚Äôm trying to think of a magical world that isn‚Äôt super dangerous. The faerie world in the Emily Wilde books sounded fun (but not if they abduct me or anything). I haven‚Äôt read a lot of fiction where the world is much better than the real one. If it was a perfect world it wouldn‚Äôt make an interesting story. I don‚Äôt think I read or watch the right things to answer this one.</p>
<p>Ah I thought of one: <em>Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service</em>. Just chill lite-witch vibes. No big scaries. Just a hint of magic in a cozy seaside town. But I‚Äôd have a little doggy friend instead of a cat. Sorry cats‚Äîyou make me sneeze!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello to the weekend. I feel torn on Saturdays between doing shop work and doing a more traditional off-work weekend. I could go either way. I have some momentum going from yesterday. I don‚Äôt often finalize art, go through all the steps and list a product all in one day. I did reorganize my inventory storage yesterday so now I have room for more sticker sheets. I have a lot of my basic functional sheets that continue to sell well. But I‚Äôm having more fun with decorative and Cookie character stickers. I feel like you need a lot to choose from to really enjoy a new character in your planner, so I‚Äôm just slowly building up Cookie‚Äôs Collection. I hope I‚Äôm right about that. My recent Cousin kit sells well too. Those take weeks to finalize the art for though, so it‚Äôs harder to start new ones.</p>
<p>Later‚Ä¶ I changed my sticker sheet pricing finally. I did some research into ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù and I realized I was under-pricing my work. I kept prices lower on my Shopify because there are less fees on each order. I hope everyone is okay with it. I just haven‚Äôt yet made enough to cover material costs, so hopefully this will help bridge that gap. Also updated my shop theme to the latest version. Yay!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I think today will be a design day. Somehow I feel like I‚Äôm already behind for Halloween even though it‚Äôs August. I am running out of room in my inventory containers for sticker sheets. It feels like hitting some kind of milestone. I‚Äôd be happier if my desk had ample room for more but the current layout is basically full. I‚Äôm going to have to re-organize the whole thing to add more space for inventory. A cool problem to have.</p>
<p>Later‚Ä¶ Well I finished, photographed and listed a Halloween Cookie sticker sheet. Woo. Lots of work but glad I have something for the upcoming spooky season. I still have more ideas but we‚Äôll see what keeps my creative flame burning long enough to finish it. Also finished season 2 of <em>Severance</em>.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 22: What‚Äôs the weirdest compliment you‚Äôve ever received?</strong><br>
The first one that comes to mind would be one I got in high school from a ‚Äúgoth kid‚Äù who said I‚Äôd make a really good ‚Äúgoth‚Äù because my skin was so pale. Haha. I suppose it‚Äôs better than the other kids who teased me for being pale, but it still remains a compliment I did not know how to respond to.</p>

<p>Ugh a medical anxiety day. My stomach is in knots. I‚Äôm trying to stay calm but the dentist will just never be my favorite thing. I‚Äôve actually gotten pretty lucky with my teeth. Only ever had one cavity. And I did have to get 4 wisdom teeth removed but that‚Äôs it. So I really have nothing to realistically be anxious about. It‚Äôs just the invasion of personal space and interacting like a normal human under the stress. No use not going to the dentist because then it would just be for a big problem somewhere down the line. I‚Äôll be an adult today‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>Later</strong> All done being an adult. Zero troubles. Got my X-rays. I went to our local fancy grocery store to look for a treat and I found my fav iced butter cookies. So that was my little reward for being a champ. Tomorrow I‚Äôll do more ‚Äúproductive‚Äù things but just trying to deal with the anxiety was enough for today.</p>
<p>Oh I got to see the full 2026 Hobo lineup this evening. None of the covers are screaming ‚Äúmust buy‚Äù but when I start seeing real people hold them I might change my mind. There is one plaid shirt fabric one that I might get. I might have to go for a cover/book combo if I want one at all since you can‚Äôt buy the covers alone for some reason. I do want those index tabs though‚Ä¶ I think.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I bought myself some new work shoes. I realized mine are super old (2019) and maybe not very supportive at all anymore. Maybe the new pair will help me feel slightly less exhausted after work. I hope so anyway. I was surprisingly tired last night and I fell asleep a whole hour earlier than usual. Not exactly sure why... maybe that potential burnout I‚Äôm trying to avoid. I must need more than usual these days.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve got some shop stuff to finalize today: inventory for the 2026 calendars and the Etsy and TikTok listings. If I feel super energetic I‚Äôd like to keep drawing my Halloween sheet too. I really should do a social media post too but that‚Äôs probably beyond my capacity today. Maybe I could just do part of it?</p>
<p>Later: I got some decent work done but also sprinkled in my fun HTML website coding so I wouldn‚Äôt get too tired of cutting stickers. The calendars are live. I also picked up an Rx I need for tomorrow. It was a good day. Tomorrow I‚Äôll probably be mentally fatigued, so again no huge projects planned. Gotta do as much self care as I can. It might not be too humid so I could actually get to go for a walk for once this month? What a dream. We‚Äôll see what happens.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I have off work this Thursday due to my dentist appointment getting rescheduled so yesterday was my only day this week. Woo! I think I'll work on a Halloween sticker sheet and get that finished this week. I got my biggest order of sticker paper yesterday. I believe this shop is going to pick up steam, so I‚Äôm increasing how much I keep in stock. Should make the busy season a little easier on me. I hope. I need to finish listing the 2026 calendars too, stalled out at the photography phase.</p>
<p><strong>Later</strong> ‚Äî Okay, I took some photos and listed them on my website‚Ä¶ only to realize I didn‚Äôt actually cut any inventory for 2 of 3 sizes. Wow brain! Whoops. So I cut some and I‚Äôll finish the rest tomorrow. I swear I‚Äôm running on brain fumes lately. I kind of wish I could take a month off for a sort of resting vacation. I‚Äôll do okay for a day or two, and then my energy just completely tanks out. I hope I don‚Äôt go full burnout mode. I‚Äôm trying to pace myself but doing it all alone just means stuff HAS to get done whether I have energy for it or not. Running a whole business requires a constant shifting of roles and usually that‚Äôs what makes it fun for me. But when I‚Äôm tired it just means all areas can suffer equally.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep for an hour. Those types of nights totally ruin my mood. I hate wondering: will I get back to sleep or will I just lay here doing nothing until morning comes? It‚Äôs probably largely because I ate a brownie after dinner. Too indulgent and my stomach said no. But when life offers you a brownie you gotta take it! lol.</p>
<p>Anyways I did take it easy yesterday but ended up with a headache anyway. I drew 3 stickers and then I told myself to stop so I could rest. I guess that was too much. Me and my body lately‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt just get along I guess.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 18: What‚Äôs your go-to response when someone asks, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù</strong><br>
Easy? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good! How are you?‚Äù Sometimes I‚Äôll throw in something about the weather: ‚ÄúSure is hot out there.‚Äù As a neurodivergent human, it‚Äôs pretty normal to script answers like this. I try to change it slightly if I know someone a little better. But often people aren‚Äôt actually curious about your life and they are just being polite ‚Äî a quick answer is sufficient and even preferred to a totally honest one.</p>

<p>Content idea: various pen tests on my sticker paper</p>
<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Yesterday was surprisingly productive. I‚Äôm going to take it easy today. I really had 3 really focused days in a row. Which is very unusual for me. Maybe I‚Äôm getting excited because Hobonichi reveals their 2026 planners every day on social media. So I‚Äôm thinking about the future! I‚Äôve been thinking about the end of year, fall, and the holidays too. Lots of projects and ideas percolating.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 17: What‚Äôs the most recent piece of advice you‚Äôve completely ignored?</strong><br>
Kind of hard to think of any. If I feel like certain advice isn‚Äôt right for me, I think I just mentally trash it after I hear it. Otherwise I just feel guilty. I guess I heard that if you have pale skin you should really be getting your skin checked regularly with a dermatologist. I‚Äôm still planning to make an appointment but I just don‚Äôt know logistically how to make the appointment and make sure it‚Äôs covered by insurance. So I‚Äôm procrastinated because ADHD makes it feel like too many steps. So it‚Äôs advice I will eventually get to but for now it‚Äôs getting ignored.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Yesterday was a good day. I hadn‚Äôt planned on designing 3 whole sticker sheets but it worked out. I‚Äôm still stuck, unable to use Adobe Illustrator when I‚Äôm cutting stickers but the calendars get started in Affinity Publisher so I could actually do design and cutting at the same time. Like I used to be able to. I really, really need a laptop so I can overcome that software glitch in the future.  It‚Äôs incredibly slowing to my whole work process. I cannot believe they haven‚Äôt fixed it yet either. I might have to figure out a stopgap workflow in Affinity Designer for awhile. I just don‚Äôt know if it has all the path tools I need like offset, simplify, smooth, etc.<br>
Very HIGH energy and productive day!</p>
<p>TCMC subscription arrived and I organized my whole sticker collection in binders. Yay!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 16: If you were a candle scent, what would be in your blend?</strong><br>
Well, I think I‚Äôd mostly have something sweet like vanilla. I‚Äôm generally a kind/sweet person with a big heart. Maybe some cinnamon for my neurospicy nature. I lean towards intensity when I do have emotions tho so maybe a hint of something stronger. I‚Äôm no fragrance expert. Maybe amber for the drama and some complexity.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Spent the day working on stuff for the shop. Got to work right away restocking low products. Then I was thinking about my next product and remembered I need to make 2026 calendar stickers for the Hobonichi planners. Took me awhile to remember how I did it last year so I documented the process this time in my Obsidian notes. Should be pretty quick from here on out. I‚Äôm just proofing them now and I should be able to get them listed this weekend. Yay! I still need to keep restocking lots of staple items and stuff some more envelopes for Q3 when I get a chance.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 15: What‚Äôs your most-used emoji, and does it fit your actual personality?</strong><br>
Mine is the blushing, smiling emoji surrounded by 3 little hearts. I think it fits me well because I do feel that way a lot. It‚Äôs like the ‚Äúawww‚Äù emoji to me. I find a lot of things cute or adorable or I‚Äôm thankful in that way. I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt an LOL emoji cuz I rarely laugh that hard like that.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Man my sleep has been so inconsistent lately. Very strange. Anyway, today is a work day. Next week I had to reschedule my dentist appt to Thursday because they didn‚Äôt have any other days. I also got some sticker sheets cut yesterday. Somehow I oversold by 1 so I had to restock ASAP. I‚Äôm always super diligent with my inventory tracking so I don‚Äôt know what happened. I‚Äôm gonna blame the tools. Not human error. Ha!! Probably, actually my fault somewhere. I wonder if other shop owners under list their inventory by 1‚Äì10 or something so they don‚Äôt oversell? The idea of keeping multiple versions of my inventory sounds more complicated than I want.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 14: If you had to eat only foods that start with one letter for the day, what letter would you choose?</strong><br>
Won‚Äôt be a very nutritious day but I‚Äôd pick M. I could have a muffin for breakfast, macaroni and cheese for dinner. I don‚Äôt know what my snacks/lunch would be tough. Uh‚Ä¶ mozzarella string cheese? Oh I could make something mini: like a mini quiche or something. And maybe some milk chocolate or a Mr. Goodbar if I‚Äôm craving dessert. IDK this is a HARD question!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I'm changing my daily habit from social media post to self-care. I'm pretty burnt out on social media so it's just not going to be a daily priority for me anymore. I'd rather work directly on my business designing new products. Those will last and add value for a lot longer than anything I put on social media anyway.</p>
<p>Last night it took me hours to fall asleep. My dental cleaning got cancelled so I think I had saved up energy for that. Then it had nowhere to go. So‚Äîinsomnia. Not all that surprising, but frustrating anyway. Maybe I'll cut a few sticker sheets to feel productive today, or work on my special app thing for Hobonichi planners. Not sure yet, but coding does seem to have my heart lately.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 13: What's your current &quot;comfort rewatch&quot; TV show, movie, or YT channel?</strong><br>
Right now I'm watching &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; but I don't know how far I'll get. It's not an ultimate favorite, but it reminds me of nostalgic fashion and high school drama. I watch old TCMC videos from Helen if I want something cozy and very chill. A classic rewatch is &quot;Supernatural&quot; for me. I've watched it many times!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Ugh I have to be an adult today and take care of my body for future me. Present day me is annoyed. I know lots of people don‚Äôt like the dentist and try to be mature about it. It will just never not be weird to have someone all up in my personal space bubble like that. I just find it awkward and that‚Äôs that. My sensory system hates it. Unfortunately it will probably drain all my good creative energy for the day so I‚Äôm not planning on any big projects for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cancelled</strong> ‚Äî Well the dentist called and had to cancel because they don‚Äôt have any power. The flooding backed up more in town, and we had a windy storm last night. I guess more places lost power. What a mess.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 12:</strong> If you could swap lives with a fictional character for one day, who would it be?<br>
Maybe a Dr. Strange type person. If I could teleport and see a bunch of world landmarks in a day that would be so cool. And the power to control reality, yeah. I don‚Äôt love travel or sleeping in hotels so just a quick trip around the world for zero money. Seems like the best way to maximize one day of a borrowed life.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Phew no major rainfall last night. Just a short storm. Hopefully it didn‚Äôt make the flooding much worse. My aunt went to the Falls and apparently it stinks so bad they didn‚Äôt stop to look. How sad! And I‚Äôve seen countless people wading into it with their kids to play. Oh the bacteria of it all. Do they not watch the news or what? M. says the lake has receded a bit overnight so that‚Äôs good. We got sooo lucky. I‚Äôm so grateful. I may have lost a little sleep but not having to gut our basement or be trapped in our neighborhood is a wonderful blessing. Hopefully none of the roads I take to work got flooded!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 11: What's your most irrational fear that you know is silly, but still have?</strong><br>
No origin story but I‚Äôm terrified of walking behind people fishing. I have a fear that they‚Äôll swing back their pole to get the line out and it will instead catch on my face and hook me. It‚Äôs such a specific thing‚Ä¶ maybe I had a nightmare like that or something. I just do NOT want to walk near anyone that‚Äôs fishing at all.</p>
<p>Much later: Let‚Äôs all just agree that Bachelor in Paradise is a ridiculous show. I don‚Äôt know why hate-watching something feels so cathartic though?</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Wow last night we got over 10 inches of rain. The thunder was so loud I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep. Then around 3 a.m. our basement water alarms went off. Went to check it out and the sump pump was full. There was water leaking in from the walls and up from a crack in the floor (that I don‚Äôt think was there before). I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. There wasn‚Äôt much to do. We turned the sump pump off and on again and it started to work again. So it was hard to settle down for sleep after that but I eventually did! Our rivers are like 2 feet higher than ever in recorded history. I‚Äôm so glad it didn‚Äôt get worse in our basement! Lots of power outages but we kept ours. I‚Äôm sure the basement would have totally flooded without the sump pump. I wonder how our neighbors did?</p>
