<p>It wasn’t too hot to function outside today! Yay!! I went for a walk with M. at a local park. The sun was warm, and there was a nice breeze. We did get attacked by mosquitos in some parts though, which was awful. Totally ruins the peaceful nature vibe. I hate them so much. I may stick to beach-only outdoor trips until we get a first frost here. The flooding probably made them a lot worse. Also there’s still a huge pile of flooding trash in our whole neighborhood. But we got an email that everything was picked up. That’s going to be a problem!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 24: Which fictional universe would you happily retire in?</strong><br>
I’m trying to think of a magical world that isn’t super dangerous. The faerie world in the Emily Wilde books sounded fun (but not if they abduct me or anything). I haven’t read a lot of fiction where the world is much better than the real one. If it was a perfect world it wouldn’t make an interesting story. I don’t think I read or watch the right things to answer this one.</p>
<p>Ah I thought of one: <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service</em>. Just chill lite-witch vibes. No big scaries. Just a hint of magic in a cozy seaside town. But I’d have a little doggy friend instead of a cat. Sorry cats—you make me sneeze!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello to the weekend. I feel torn on Saturdays between doing shop work and doing a more traditional off-work weekend. I could go either way. I have some momentum going from yesterday. I don’t often finalize art, go through all the steps and list a product all in one day. I did reorganize my inventory storage yesterday so now I have room for more sticker sheets. I have a lot of my basic functional sheets that continue to sell well. But I’m having more fun with decorative and Cookie character stickers. I feel like you need a lot to choose from to really enjoy a new character in your planner, so I’m just slowly building up Cookie’s Collection. I hope I’m right about that. My recent Cousin kit sells well too. Those take weeks to finalize the art for though, so it’s harder to start new ones.</p>
<p>Later… I changed my sticker sheet pricing finally. I did some research into “competitors” and I realized I was under-pricing my work. I kept prices lower on my Shopify because there are less fees on each order. I hope everyone is okay with it. I just haven’t yet made enough to cover material costs, so hopefully this will help bridge that gap. Also updated my shop theme to the latest version. Yay!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I think today will be a design day. Somehow I feel like I’m already behind for Halloween even though it’s August. I am running out of room in my inventory containers for sticker sheets. It feels like hitting some kind of milestone. I’d be happier if my desk had ample room for more but the current layout is basically full. I’m going to have to re-organize the whole thing to add more space for inventory. A cool problem to have.</p>
<p>Later… Well I finished, photographed and listed a Halloween Cookie sticker sheet. Woo. Lots of work but glad I have something for the upcoming spooky season. I still have more ideas but we’ll see what keeps my creative flame burning long enough to finish it. Also finished season 2 of <em>Severance</em>.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 22: What’s the weirdest compliment you’ve ever received?</strong><br>
The first one that comes to mind would be one I got in high school from a “goth kid” who said I’d make a really good “goth” because my skin was so pale. Haha. I suppose it’s better than the other kids who teased me for being pale, but it still remains a compliment I did not know how to respond to.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Ugh a medical anxiety day. My stomach is in knots. I’m trying to stay calm but the dentist will just never be my favorite thing. I’ve actually gotten pretty lucky with my teeth. Only ever had one cavity. And I did have to get 4 wisdom teeth removed but that’s it. So I really have nothing to realistically be anxious about. It’s just the invasion of personal space and interacting like a normal human under the stress. No use not going to the dentist because then it would just be for a big problem somewhere down the line. I’ll be an adult today…</p>
<p><strong>Later</strong> All done being an adult. Zero troubles. Got my X-rays. I went to our local fancy grocery store to look for a treat and I found my fav iced butter cookies. So that was my little reward for being a champ. Tomorrow I’ll do more “productive” things but just trying to deal with the anxiety was enough for today.</p>
<p>Oh I got to see the full 2026 Hobo lineup this evening. None of the covers are screaming “must buy” but when I start seeing real people hold them I might change my mind. There is one plaid shirt fabric one that I might get. I might have to go for a cover/book combo if I want one at all since you can’t buy the covers alone for some reason. I do want those index tabs though… I think.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I bought myself some new work shoes. I realized mine are super old (2019) and maybe not very supportive at all anymore. Maybe the new pair will help me feel slightly less exhausted after work. I hope so anyway. I was surprisingly tired last night and I fell asleep a whole hour earlier than usual. Not exactly sure why... maybe that potential burnout I’m trying to avoid. I must need more than usual these days.</p>
<p>I’ve got some shop stuff to finalize today: inventory for the 2026 calendars and the Etsy and TikTok listings. If I feel super energetic I’d like to keep drawing my Halloween sheet too. I really should do a social media post too but that’s probably beyond my capacity today. Maybe I could just do part of it?</p>
<p>Later: I got some decent work done but also sprinkled in my fun HTML website coding so I wouldn’t get too tired of cutting stickers. The calendars are live. I also picked up an Rx I need for tomorrow. It was a good day. Tomorrow I’ll probably be mentally fatigued, so again no huge projects planned. Gotta do as much self care as I can. It might not be too humid so I could actually get to go for a walk for once this month? What a dream. We’ll see what happens.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I have off work this Thursday due to my dentist appointment getting rescheduled so yesterday was my only day this week. Woo! I think I'll work on a Halloween sticker sheet and get that finished this week. I got my biggest order of sticker paper yesterday. I believe this shop is going to pick up steam, so I’m increasing how much I keep in stock. Should make the busy season a little easier on me. I hope. I need to finish listing the 2026 calendars too, stalled out at the photography phase.</p>
<p><strong>Later</strong> — Okay, I took some photos and listed them on my website… only to realize I didn’t actually cut any inventory for 2 of 3 sizes. Wow brain! Whoops. So I cut some and I’ll finish the rest tomorrow. I swear I’m running on brain fumes lately. I kind of wish I could take a month off for a sort of resting vacation. I’ll do okay for a day or two, and then my energy just completely tanks out. I hope I don’t go full burnout mode. I’m trying to pace myself but doing it all alone just means stuff HAS to get done whether I have energy for it or not. Running a whole business requires a constant shifting of roles and usually that’s what makes it fun for me. But when I’m tired it just means all areas can suffer equally.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn’t get back to sleep for an hour. Those types of nights totally ruin my mood. I hate wondering: will I get back to sleep or will I just lay here doing nothing until morning comes? It’s probably largely because I ate a brownie after dinner. Too indulgent and my stomach said no. But when life offers you a brownie you gotta take it! lol.</p>
<p>Anyways I did take it easy yesterday but ended up with a headache anyway. I drew 3 stickers and then I told myself to stop so I could rest. I guess that was too much. Me and my body lately… can’t just get along I guess.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 18: What’s your go-to response when someone asks, “How’s it going?”</strong><br>
Easy? “I’m good! How are you?” Sometimes I’ll throw in something about the weather: “Sure is hot out there.” As a neurodivergent human, it’s pretty normal to script answers like this. I try to change it slightly if I know someone a little better. But often people aren’t actually curious about your life and they are just being polite — a quick answer is sufficient and even preferred to a totally honest one.</p>

<h2>Word</h2>
<p><strong>glitch</strong> <em>(noun)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>an informal word referring to an unexpected and usually minor problem, especially used for a minor problem with a machine or device, such as a computer.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The email went out to everyone in the company because of a technical glitch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Content idea: various pen tests on my sticker paper</p>
<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Yesterday was surprisingly productive. I’m going to take it easy today. I really had 3 really focused days in a row. Which is very unusual for me. Maybe I’m getting excited because Hobonichi reveals their 2026 planners every day on social media. So I’m thinking about the future! I’ve been thinking about the end of year, fall, and the holidays too. Lots of projects and ideas percolating.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 17: What’s the most recent piece of advice you’ve completely ignored?</strong><br>
Kind of hard to think of any. If I feel like certain advice isn’t right for me, I think I just mentally trash it after I hear it. Otherwise I just feel guilty. I guess I heard that if you have pale skin you should really be getting your skin checked regularly with a dermatologist. I’m still planning to make an appointment but I just don’t know logistically how to make the appointment and make sure it’s covered by insurance. So I’m procrastinated because ADHD makes it feel like too many steps. So it’s advice I will eventually get to but for now it’s getting ignored.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Yesterday was a good day. I hadn’t planned on designing 3 whole sticker sheets but it worked out. I’m still stuck, unable to use Adobe Illustrator when I’m cutting stickers but the calendars get started in Affinity Publisher so I could actually do design and cutting at the same time. Like I used to be able to. I really, really need a laptop so I can overcome that software glitch in the future.  It’s incredibly slowing to my whole work process. I cannot believe they haven’t fixed it yet either. I might have to figure out a stopgap workflow in Affinity Designer for awhile. I just don’t know if it has all the path tools I need like offset, simplify, smooth, etc.<br>
Very HIGH energy and productive day!</p>
<p>TCMC subscription arrived and I organized my whole sticker collection in binders. Yay!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 16: If you were a candle scent, what would be in your blend?</strong><br>
Well, I think I’d mostly have something sweet like vanilla. I’m generally a kind/sweet person with a big heart. Maybe some cinnamon for my neurospicy nature. I lean towards intensity when I do have emotions tho so maybe a hint of something stronger. I’m no fragrance expert. Maybe amber for the drama and some complexity.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Spent the day working on stuff for the shop. Got to work right away restocking low products. Then I was thinking about my next product and remembered I need to make 2026 calendar stickers for the Hobonichi planners. Took me awhile to remember how I did it last year so I documented the process this time in my Obsidian notes. Should be pretty quick from here on out. I’m just proofing them now and I should be able to get them listed this weekend. Yay! I still need to keep restocking lots of staple items and stuff some more envelopes for Q3 when I get a chance.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 15: What’s your most-used emoji, and does it fit your actual personality?</strong><br>
Mine is the blushing, smiling emoji surrounded by 3 little hearts. I think it fits me well because I do feel that way a lot. It’s like the “awww” emoji to me. I find a lot of things cute or adorable or I’m thankful in that way. I’m glad it wasn’t an LOL emoji cuz I rarely laugh that hard like that.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Man my sleep has been so inconsistent lately. Very strange. Anyway, today is a work day. Next week I had to reschedule my dentist appt to Thursday because they didn’t have any other days. I also got some sticker sheets cut yesterday. Somehow I oversold by 1 so I had to restock ASAP. I’m always super diligent with my inventory tracking so I don’t know what happened. I’m gonna blame the tools. Not human error. Ha!! Probably, actually my fault somewhere. I wonder if other shop owners under list their inventory by 1–10 or something so they don’t oversell? The idea of keeping multiple versions of my inventory sounds more complicated than I want.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 14: If you had to eat only foods that start with one letter for the day, what letter would you choose?</strong><br>
Won’t be a very nutritious day but I’d pick M. I could have a muffin for breakfast, macaroni and cheese for dinner. I don’t know what my snacks/lunch would be tough. Uh… mozzarella string cheese? Oh I could make something mini: like a mini quiche or something. And maybe some milk chocolate or a Mr. Goodbar if I’m craving dessert. IDK this is a HARD question!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I'm changing my daily habit from social media post to self-care. I'm pretty burnt out on social media so it's just not going to be a daily priority for me anymore. I'd rather work directly on my business designing new products. Those will last and add value for a lot longer than anything I put on social media anyway.</p>
<p>Last night it took me hours to fall asleep. My dental cleaning got cancelled so I think I had saved up energy for that. Then it had nowhere to go. So—insomnia. Not all that surprising, but frustrating anyway. Maybe I'll cut a few sticker sheets to feel productive today, or work on my special app thing for Hobonichi planners. Not sure yet, but coding does seem to have my heart lately.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 13: What's your current &quot;comfort rewatch&quot; TV show, movie, or YT channel?</strong><br>
Right now I'm watching &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; but I don't know how far I'll get. It's not an ultimate favorite, but it reminds me of nostalgic fashion and high school drama. I watch old TCMC videos from Helen if I want something cozy and very chill. A classic rewatch is &quot;Supernatural&quot; for me. I've watched it many times!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Ugh I have to be an adult today and take care of my body for future me. Present day me is annoyed. I know lots of people don’t like the dentist and try to be mature about it. It will just never not be weird to have someone all up in my personal space bubble like that. I just find it awkward and that’s that. My sensory system hates it. Unfortunately it will probably drain all my good creative energy for the day so I’m not planning on any big projects for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cancelled</strong> — Well the dentist called and had to cancel because they don’t have any power. The flooding backed up more in town, and we had a windy storm last night. I guess more places lost power. What a mess.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 12:</strong> If you could swap lives with a fictional character for one day, who would it be?<br>
Maybe a Dr. Strange type person. If I could teleport and see a bunch of world landmarks in a day that would be so cool. And the power to control reality, yeah. I don’t love travel or sleeping in hotels so just a quick trip around the world for zero money. Seems like the best way to maximize one day of a borrowed life.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Phew no major rainfall last night. Just a short storm. Hopefully it didn’t make the flooding much worse. My aunt went to the Falls and apparently it stinks so bad they didn’t stop to look. How sad! And I’ve seen countless people wading into it with their kids to play. Oh the bacteria of it all. Do they not watch the news or what? M. says the lake has receded a bit overnight so that’s good. We got sooo lucky. I’m so grateful. I may have lost a little sleep but not having to gut our basement or be trapped in our neighborhood is a wonderful blessing. Hopefully none of the roads I take to work got flooded!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 11: What's your most irrational fear that you know is silly, but still have?</strong><br>
No origin story but I’m terrified of walking behind people fishing. I have a fear that they’ll swing back their pole to get the line out and it will instead catch on my face and hook me. It’s such a specific thing… maybe I had a nightmare like that or something. I just do NOT want to walk near anyone that’s fishing at all.</p>
<p>Much later: Let’s all just agree that Bachelor in Paradise is a ridiculous show. I don’t know why hate-watching something feels so cathartic though?</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Wow last night we got over 10 inches of rain. The thunder was so loud I couldn’t fall asleep. Then around 3 a.m. our basement water alarms went off. Went to check it out and the sump pump was full. There was water leaking in from the walls and up from a crack in the floor (that I don’t think was there before). I’ve never seen anything like it. There wasn’t much to do. We turned the sump pump off and on again and it started to work again. So it was hard to settle down for sleep after that but I eventually did! Our rivers are like 2 feet higher than ever in recorded history. I’m so glad it didn’t get worse in our basement! Lots of power outages but we kept ours. I’m sure the basement would have totally flooded without the sump pump. I wonder how our neighbors did?</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Backfill: I spent the whole day on a new project. I finally figured out an easy workflow. I put the code on GitHub as a repository and then open the code space to edit the code. From there I use a Live Server extension to test all my changes — quick and easy in another browser window. I can even use my iPad, which is mainly what I use daily anywhere. I made lots of progress and figured out how to commit changes to Git as I went. I’m creating a super fun tool for anyone who wants to track their weather in a planner or journal.</p>
<p>I’m doing most of the code in JavaScript, which I’m honestly not super familiar with, but this project isn’t super complex — it’s layout heavy. So it’s fun to learn as I go. The more I change, the more I understand it. I’m thinking I can make a few of the styles available free, then maybe add a one-time paid upgrade to unlock more themes and options. IDK — I’ve never sold a code project like this before. I’ve made tools for myself, but if it breaks I can either abandon it or try to fix it. IDK if I’d be all that helpful in a “tech support” scenario. I’ll just wait and see how I feel once it’s finished.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I had a terrible time trying to fall asleep last night. I just couldn’t relax. IDK if it’s dental appt anxiety or what, but that isn’t until next week. Terribly annoying. So I started today with a super relaxing bath. Just want to wash away the bad vibes. I think I’ll take it kind of slow today. Might do some fun coding but nothing super taxing. I just don’t have a lot of extra mental resources right now. Plus I’ve already released 2 new sticker sheets so far this month. That’s quite good for me!</p>
<p>Later: I got a terrible headache so the rest of the day was mostly a wash. I was trying to teach myself more code stuff. Then me and M. decided to go out for dinner and I realized my head hurt. It didn’t get worse though so I’m surviving… just tired I guess. Yuck.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 8:</strong> If you could rename one everyday object to something sillier, what would you call it?<br>
Like calling a fork a “dinglehopper” in <em>The Little Mermaid</em>. Well I recently used a “gentle” exfoliator and think a better name might be Pain Paste. (It was shockingly aggressive.)</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Yesterday was surprisingly productive. I designed, printed, and cut a whole new sticker sheet. Whoa! I eventually found the missing Apple Pencil and was inspired to make a sheet about clutter and disorganization. I love it! I just need to take product photos and then it can go live. Might be one of my fastest sheets ever with fresh artwork. Nothing is more inspiring than actual lived experience for me. I can feel if the message is being conveyed properly in my bones, I gotta remember to use that more often. It just feels good to process life through art that way. Like my life has more meaning than just something I experience alone.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 7: What's your personal &quot;comfy clothes&quot; uniform?</strong><br>
I never understood this growing up — it felt like all clothes were the same comfort (except for tight jeans). Then I grew up, gained a little weight. Man, everything digs and pulls and feels weird! If I can go a whole day with no bra (or light bralette), pajama shirt, and sweatpants, I'm very happy. I always take off my “outside clothes” first thing when I'm home for the day now. It's sooo much better. Jeans are the worst.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I lost my Apple Pencil again and I can’t find it anywhere. I really wish the Magic Keyboard case had a secure spot for it. The magnet is totally unreliable. And it always hides once it falls off. It’s never just on the floor near the iPad or anything easy like that. And I don’t have the version with Find My device detection either.<br>
Plus I just have zero storage space to organize all my stuff. So that makes the search a lot more frustrating and difficult. Running a stationery shop out of your bedroom is NOT ideal.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 6: When was the last time you laughed so hard you couldn’t breathe?</strong><br>
Well I can remember a recent cry and laugh combo. I was talking about how I struggle to say yes to new things and new people. And they said “Your brain runs on binding contracts. Yes = now I’ve agreed to coffee every month until one of us dies.” It sounds so silly and ridiculous but it resonated so hard that I just cried and laughed about the weirdness that is my brain. Like that’s obviously ridiculous… a yes does not equal a lifetime contract, but for some reason that’s what I think.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Had a bit of an emotional day yesterday. Someone I used to work with came into work and told me some news, which wasn't a big deal in itself. It was just on the 40 min drive home while my mind wandered. I was just comparing my life and wondering why mine was so different… wondering if I missed my chances… wondering why some things just don't work out how you hope they would… and so on. Just feeling overwhelmed by emotions in general. I think I just needed a good cry to reset and get it out. I know comparison is pointless and unhelpful. It just snuck up on me. I am still grieving various things and sometimes you just gotta get it out. I think I feel better today. I think I handled the emotions well and processed some stuff that was building up. Key takeaway: It's okay to feel old negative thoughts, but then be sure to let them go. You can't just DENY them away because you're &quot;not supposed&quot; to think them. Negative stuff just happens. Old brain programming doesn't just disappear overnight. Feel it, then reframe it and move on. I think sometimes you hear advice like &quot;comparison is the thief of joy,&quot; so then maybe you feel guilty when you accidentally compare yourself to others. But that's not helpful either. It's okay, and you can get through it.</p>
