## Journal
Wow last night we got over 10 inches of rain. The thunder was so loud I couldn’t fall asleep. Then around 3 a.m. our basement water alarms went off. Went to check it out and the sump pump was full. There was water leaking in from the walls and up from a crack in the floor (that I don’t think was there before). I’ve never seen anything like it. There wasn’t much to do. We turned the sump pump off and on again and it started to work again. So it was hard to settle down for sleep after that but I eventually did! Our rivers are like 2 feet higher than ever in recorded history. I’m so glad it didn’t get worse in our basement! Lots of power outages but we kept ours. I’m sure the basement would have totally flooded without the sump pump. I wonder how our neighbors did?
