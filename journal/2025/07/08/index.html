<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello Tuesday. Had 2 big orders to fill first thing today. Yay! I wasn‚Äôt expecting a little burst at this time of year. It feels really nice. I‚Äôll have to restock quite a few products now. But I do need to buckle down and focus on a custom order first. It‚Äôs for 2 tiny icons. Only part I don‚Äôt love is cutting them. It takes foreverrrrr!</p>
<p>I also need unique SKUs for bundles because manually adjusting inventory is tedious. And when I make sales on Shopify or TikTok it doesn‚Äôt update Etsy‚Äîwhich is such a pain. So much manual inventory adjusting. I‚Äôm sure I make mistakes all the time.</p>
<p>Later: I finished my custom order. My cutting machine didn‚Äôt miscut any sheets. Super awesome! Made the whole process so much faster than sometimes. I‚Äôll mail that one out tomorrow. Also got the listings for both sheets drafted up. Just need to take the pictures now and they‚Äôll be live. I love when the whole design process just goes smoothly from start to finish. I can troubleshoot but I much prefer when everything just does what it‚Äôs supposed to.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 8: When doubts sneak in (especially on low-energy days), what helps you regroup or reset?</strong><br>
Time away is often very effective. If I‚Äôm letting negative thoughts win, it probably means I‚Äôm too tired to be trying to swing big on things. Or I‚Äôve just been trying too hard, for too long, and I need a fresh perspective. Rest is key!</p>
<h2>üìå Summary</h2>

<li>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Missed habits</strong>: sm post, yoga/movement</li>
