## Word
**largesse** *(noun)*  
- A somewhat formal word that refers to the act of giving away money or the generosity of a person who gives away money  
> *The community has benefited greatly from the largesse of its wealthiest family.*  
> *The local business owner is a philanthropist known for his largesse.*

## Journal
I lost my Apple Pencil again and I can’t find it anywhere. I really wish the Magic Keyboard case had a secure spot for it. The magnet is totally unreliable. And it always hides once it falls off. It’s never just on the floor near the iPad or anything easy like that. And I don’t have the version with Find My device detection either.  
Plus I just have zero storage space to organize all my stuff. So that makes the search a lot more frustrating and difficult. Running a stationery shop out of your bedroom is NOT ideal.

## Prompt
**Prompt 6: When was the last time you laughed so hard you couldn’t breathe?**  
Well I can remember a recent cry and laugh combo. I was talking about how I struggle to say yes to new things and new people. And they said “Your brain runs on binding contracts. Yes = now I’ve agreed to coffee every month until one of us dies.” It sounds so silly and ridiculous but it resonated so hard that I just cried and laughed about the weirdness that is my brain. Like that’s obviously ridiculous… a yes does not equal a lifetime contract, but for some reason that’s what I think.
