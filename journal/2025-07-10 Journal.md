## Journal
Just another ordinary work day. I had a bit of an emotional mood swing yesterday... just wondering about my business — if I’ll ever be able to expand and grow. I was worried my workflow isn’t really scaleable... which it’s not super flexible. Cutting everything myself is time consuming. But also don’t think I would want the shop if I could only ever design all day. I like how I can do accounting some days. Or customer support. Or social media. I like not needing all creative energy all the time. 

Yes, sometimes I would like help with production — so I can keep up with my flow of ideas. But that could be more of a long-term goal for now. Need patience for now. I was just thinking too many steps ahead yesterday. The path doesn’t need to be clear yet. I’m still learning and growing, just slowly — and that’s okay!

## Prompt
**Prompt 10: What kind of advice do you actually find helpful — and what kind drives you a little nuts?**  
Well most obviously I like specific advice from someone who knows me well. Not something I’ve likely already thought of (which I think of a lot so that can be hard). And advice delivered with true care — not the kind to make me shut up or stop talking about something. Nothing judgey — just thoughtful and considerate advice. I imagine that’s all true for most people though.
