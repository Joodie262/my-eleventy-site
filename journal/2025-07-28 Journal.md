## Journal
Another summer day, another heat advisory. Over it! Anyways I got caught up on life yesterday. Ready for this week and the next month too. I did troubleshoot my holiday sticker sheet again yesterday. I made every mistake possible. Also the stickers weren’t sized for my Hobonichi at all… I don’t know what my poor brain was thinking when I started working on it. But I think the design is finished anyways. I guess I’ll sell a small version since I made all the files anyway. I never know what planners my customers use outside of Hobonichi so it can’t hurt. It should be a nice year round and end of year product to have. I hope it’s well liked for all the headaches it has caused me.

## Prompt
**Prompt 28: What’s one small thing that made you smile this week?**  
I got new stickers from TheCoffeeMonsterzCo in the mail. That’s always a happy day. New stickers are the best. New ways to express myself in my planner. Also someone on social media asked about my planner and said she wanted to start one. I’m so glad I could inspire someone to try something new. My planner brings me so much peace and joy. So I’m very happy to share that.
