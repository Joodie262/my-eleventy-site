## Journal
Hello weekend! I saw my cousin's kids yesterday at a dinner. So good to see them.  
Also got some important shop work done too! My Q3 freebie sticker sheet is ready to go!  
Today I need to finalize and post the journaling prompts for July. That always seems  
to take a lot longer than I think it should. But I just like to have it in multiple  
places so people can find it easily.  

I've had a few people ask me on social media where I get my prompts from—so maybe  
someone out there actually uses them. No way to know really. I hope they do.  
At least I know that I use them! Haha.

## Prompt
**What smell, sound, or taste instantly reminds you of summer?**  
Fireworks and grilled food.  
A sound and a smell that are mostly only encountered during the warm months.  
Or thunderstorms with that crazy thick humidity that feels like a blanket.  
And just humid air. Helps my dry skin feel better but I feel awful in every other way.  
My poor hair. Although learning the Curly Girl method has helped—my hair can still  
flop on a super humid and hot day.
