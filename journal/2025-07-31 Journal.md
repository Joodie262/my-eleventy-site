## Journal
Last work day of the month. I feel like July was both fast and slow. I hated all the heat and humidity. I just stayed inside the whole month. It was miserable. We had one or two good days and I was busy with work for both. No idea what August will hold but it’s typically a hot and humid one too. This whole weekend should be way nicer though so I’m gonna go to a beach at least once. I’m going stir crazy inside.

I spent all day yesterday comparing my Eleventy site to my Grow site. I’m not sure which I like better. Cloudflare kept injecting extra code into my 11ty site and breaking the footer. So I turned it off for that subdomain. But I do hate the manual FTP process. Maybe I need different software? It’s just slow for even tiny files. Maybe I should FTP right from VS Code itself instead of using Forklift? Apparently my hosting isn’t compatible with the more modern tools (like GitHub) so it just slows everything down. Maybe I should consider switching hosting companies? This one’s affordable and I’ve used them forever. Migrating servers always becomes a nightmare. All the databases and DNS and subdomains and emails and all the custom rules and logins. It always sucks…
