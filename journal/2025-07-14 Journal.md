## Journal
I caught up on a lot of work things yesterday. Maybe my 2 days of rest paid off. I restocked a lot of sheets that had been low for awhile. Even had a super energy boost and posted to social media and made time for yoga. Yesterday was very balanced.

I got my yarn in the mail for the crochet project I wanted to start. The yarn is SUPER hard to work with though. It's so fuzzy I can't see my stitches at all. I always lose track of what number I'm on so I need to recount a lot. I have no idea how anyone works with soft, fuzzy yarn. You just have to trust your intuition when adding stitches I guess?

I was able to use a much larger hook for a much looser look... but it's still quite difficult to use. IDK what to do for my project now. Gotta think about my options.

## Prompt
**Prompt 14: How do you set the tone for your week ahead‚Äîintentionally or accidentally?**  
I'm not sure I really set a tone. I try to just let each day come as it is. I guess if I don't start out organized it can mean a difficult week. But I'm pretty good at finishing laundry and setting up the planner all by Sunday night. So maybe I set the tone just by sticking to my routine.
