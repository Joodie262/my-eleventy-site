## Journal
I realized I made a HUGE mistake yesterday. I worked on the art for my holidays sticker sheet all day. When I went to export, I realized the image was half the size it was supposed to be. But I did do it at 600 DPI. So I attempted to resize it a few ways. Most looked terrible, except one: manually copying layers a few at a time and transforming the scale to 200%. It was tedious but the art doesn't look too awful. I'll have to do a test print to see if it's visible at the final size. Otherwise, I need to redraw 33 stickers' worth of art. (I REALLY hope it looks okay!)  
It happened because I changed the DPI on the file from 300 to 600 and Procreate decided I had too many layers, so it shrank the canvas size without telling me. It‚Äôs just a complex sticker sheet so it had lots of layers.

## Prompt
**Prompt 27: What's something you're pretty good at that could help you this month?**  
I think problem solving in general. I'm tenacious when I try to do something I want to do. When I hit speedbumps I get stubborn and keep figuring stuff out... usually. Like this cursed sticker sheet that is testing ALL of my skills.
