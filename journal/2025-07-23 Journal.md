## Journal
Well since I filled my planner last night and now it's the beginning of the next day I don’t have much to report. I slept well. It’s too hot today. Very boring stuff so far.

I did spend a crazy amount of time fiddling with the code for my journal digitizing website yesterday. I have 0 experience with the templating language Nunjucks. So eventually I had to give up. You'd think it wouldn’t be that hard but the date formatting just would NOT cooperate. As much as I love the idea of handcoded websites I may not be nerdy enough to do anything intermediate or advanced really. HTML only gets me so far.

## Prompt
**Prompt 23: What’s brought you surprise joy this year so far?**  
I think coming back to old hobbies. Things I thought I might never do again like crochet and HTML. I don’t know why it takes me so long to come back to certain things — even when they bring me a lot of joy. Probably they just lose their novelty and my ADHD wants variety. But it’s always nice to realize I actually remember some knowledge from a long time ago.
