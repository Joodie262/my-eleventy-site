## Journal
My phone turned on! Yay! So far no issues. I’ll wait until later tonight to plug it in and charge it. Glad I can use it to clock in at work today. Phew! Got really lucky. I got a big order in my shop over the weekend. Super cool when lots of my products resonate with a customer. It’s kind of like we get each other even though I don’t know them at all! Haha!  
Today is the best weather day of the week. I wish I could go for a hike but I have to work. The weather hasn’t been kind to me at all this year. I haven’t had many good days to go out. I miss my parks from last year. Maybe by fall it will cool off enough?!

## Prompt
**Prompt 7: What’s a favorite memory of fireworks, parades, or summer celebrations?**  
Maybe when I was a kid I walked the parade a few times, I’m not positive why? Girl Scouts? My day car? A horse barn? Gymnastics? But I think one year I got to walk a dog—a family friend’s dog I really liked. A rottweiler. It was just plain fun. Too bad I can’t remember more details… I’ll have to ask my mom. Otherwise just seeing fireworks with my family. Good quality time.
