## Journal  
I finally had a little more normal energy yesterday. It was a nice balanced day of work, self care, and fun. I did most of my habits! Yay! I have one particular sticker sheet that keeps getting purchased (weekly grid tracker) so I restocked those. Then I also played a fun RPG game (well I started setting it up at least) so that was fun just for me.

Today is another ordinary work day. Just one pallet of boxes so not too bad. Shouldn‚Äôt take too long. Gotta wrap some presents tonight for A‚Äôs birthday. We‚Äôre supposed to get together tomorrow. Should be fun!

## Prompt 26  
**What‚Äôs something you‚Äôve done lately that even you didn‚Äôt see coming?**  
I think attempting to truly organize my chaotic bedroom. It‚Äôs something I put off chronically because of my ADHD. But I was just looking around thinking ‚Äúthere has to be a way to handle this.‚Äù So I started writing down every single item. (Not really practical for all categories of things) but for all the random stuff. Then seeing certain things in plain text made it look easier to realize what was obvious junk. And eventually, I hope to get reasonable categories going for what remains. Because it‚Äôs all utterly RANDOM right now. Of course I can never find anything. Even if it‚Äôs just a shelf or two, I know it will help in the long run. At least I can run a text search for some stuff and waste a lot less time!
