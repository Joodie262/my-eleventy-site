## Journal
Writing this in the evening instead of my usual morning or afternoon. Just didn’t make time to check-in until now. It was a good day. It felt hot and sticky today and we’re in for the next 2 days to have heat advisories and heat indexes at 100° or more. Ew! I’ll probably be staying in and doing shop work all day tomorrow. I got 2 new tiny icon sticker sheets listed just now. I had the package sheet designed for at least 6 months but it just got forgotten. So I finally cut and finalized those. Yay! Procrastinate much? At least it’s done. I haven’t been making any progress on my fall sticker designs. I feel like I have infinite time until the end of the year. Just super hard to feel any need for immediacy there. Eventually I’ll get it done.

## Prompt
**Prompt 22: What’s one creative or light-hearted way you’ve solved a small problem lately?**  
Well honestly just looking at what other people do is usually all the inspiration I need. Like tackling a big crochet project. I knew of crochet diagrams but had never tried them. Turns out they exist for a reason—they help! No need to reinvent the wheel!
