## Journal
I had a terrible time trying to fall asleep last night. I just couldn’t relax. IDK if it’s dental appt anxiety or what, but that isn’t until next week. Terribly annoying. So I started today with a super relaxing bath. Just want to wash away the bad vibes. I think I’ll take it kind of slow today. Might do some fun coding but nothing super taxing. I just don’t have a lot of extra mental resources right now. Plus I’ve already released 2 new sticker sheets so far this month. That’s quite good for me!

Later: I got a terrible headache so the rest of the day was mostly a wash. I was trying to teach myself more code stuff. Then me and M. decided to go out for dinner and I realized my head hurt. It didn’t get worse though so I’m surviving… just tired I guess. Yuck.

## Prompt
**Prompt 8:** If you could rename one everyday object to something sillier, what would you call it?  
Like calling a fork a “dinglehopper” in *The Little Mermaid*. Well I recently used a “gentle” exfoliator and think a better name might be Pain Paste. (It was shockingly aggressive.)
