## Journal
Chilling in the AC on this hot Sunday. No outdoors for me.  
Yesterday I finished my first rock tumble of the year. Just took 2 long months. I have a beautiful red banded agate with a little crystal pocket in it. It's so pretty! I also have a lot of random beach rocks — so not everything was 100% shiny. But still some good stuff. I have a lot of small pieces so maybe I'll turn those into jewelry or something. I need to really look at them in the daylight to see if any fractures formed or anything.

## Prompt
**Prompt 29: How do you plan a weekend that’s both productive and chill?**  
Very loose goal setting — maybe one or two goals max. Mostly the weekends are for catching up on boring life tasks like laundry. So even if I don’t go above and beyond, it’s still a fairly productive weekend.  
I also just allow myself to not work, which introduces the chill aspect.  
I start out my days chill but fun. I mostly just push through the boring stuff quick and then play with what time is left over (if any). Usually a creative project is involved like creating, building, making something or researching how I want to make something.  
The weekends are more ebb and flow, so I don’t structure too much.
