## Journal
Stuck in wait mode because I have an appointment later today. I don’t want to start anything because then I’ll have to stop. And I always lose track of time if I’m doing anything remotely interesting. So instead I doom scroll. I guess it’s both an ADHD thing and an autism thing. Fun. /sarcasm

I was reading some of my super old blog posts from 2008–2010 last night. I swear I don’t remember at least half of what I talk about. It’s kind of weird. Like a whole different person wrote them. Also the absolute chaotic OBVIOUSLY ADHD tone is wild to me. I thought I was being coherent? I switch subjects every 2 sentences with zero segue. I still do that but I’m aware of it. Who even was I as a teen? The mood swings of it all. I’m so happy I’m older now. Some thoughts actually have space around them.

## Prompt
**Prompt 29: What’s a summer activity that always makes you feel like yourself?**  
Hah well staying indoors in the A/C is a very me thing to do. And it’s been hot so I’ve been very much me. But lately, if I can go to a beach and look at rocks I feel much more grounded and present. A simple task to keep my mind occupied but also peaceful.
