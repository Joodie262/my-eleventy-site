## Journal
Sooo I made a big oopsie yesterday. I put my phone in the washing machine with all of my laundry. Ugh! I realized it super quickly… maybe only 2–4 minutes tops. So I got it out, took off the case, and dried it right away. The internet said to power it off for 24–48 hours. We had some silica packets, so I surrounded it with those and aimed a fan at it. I can’t really go to work tomorrow without a phone so I can’t do the full 48 hours. I hope it’s okay.

I can’t really afford a new one right now. I’m doing everything from my iPad for now. So grateful I have that as an option. I just feel weird without a phone.

## Prompt
**Prompt 6: How do you choose what actually matters on a high-energy summer day?**  
Well, high energy usually means it’s easier for me to prioritize and make decisions. So I’ll usually feel a strong pull to one task more than any other and just start immediately with that. I don’t feel “high energy” very often so just going with my gut is a safe bet to ride the wave. Some days that means intense focus on one single project. Other days it means keeping lots of plates spinning in the air at once.
