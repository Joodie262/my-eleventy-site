<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Man my sleep has been so inconsistent lately. Very strange. Anyway, today is a work day. Next week I had to reschedule my dentist appt to Thursday because they didn‚Äôt have any other days. I also got some sticker sheets cut yesterday. Somehow I oversold by 1 so I had to restock ASAP. I‚Äôm always super diligent with my inventory tracking so I don‚Äôt know what happened. I‚Äôm gonna blame the tools. Not human error. Ha!! Probably, actually my fault somewhere. I wonder if other shop owners under list their inventory by 1‚Äì10 or something so they don‚Äôt oversell? The idea of keeping multiple versions of my inventory sounds more complicated than I want.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 14: If you had to eat only foods that start with one letter for the day, what letter would you choose?</strong><br>
Won‚Äôt be a very nutritious day but I‚Äôd pick M. I could have a muffin for breakfast, macaroni and cheese for dinner. I don‚Äôt know what my snacks/lunch would be tough. Uh‚Ä¶ mozzarella string cheese? Oh I could make something mini: like a mini quiche or something. And maybe some milk chocolate or a Mr. Goodbar if I‚Äôm craving dessert. IDK this is a HARD question!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I'm changing my daily habit from social media post to self-care. I'm pretty burnt out on social media so it's just not going to be a daily priority for me anymore. I'd rather work directly on my business designing new products. Those will last and add value for a lot longer than anything I put on social media anyway.</p>
<p>Last night it took me hours to fall asleep. My dental cleaning got cancelled so I think I had saved up energy for that. Then it had nowhere to go. So‚Äîinsomnia. Not all that surprising, but frustrating anyway. Maybe I'll cut a few sticker sheets to feel productive today, or work on my special app thing for Hobonichi planners. Not sure yet, but coding does seem to have my heart lately.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 13: What's your current &quot;comfort rewatch&quot; TV show, movie, or YT channel?</strong><br>
Right now I'm watching &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; but I don't know how far I'll get. It's not an ultimate favorite, but it reminds me of nostalgic fashion and high school drama. I watch old TCMC videos from Helen if I want something cozy and very chill. A classic rewatch is &quot;Supernatural&quot; for me. I've watched it many times!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Ugh I have to be an adult today and take care of my body for future me. Present day me is annoyed. I know lots of people don‚Äôt like the dentist and try to be mature about it. It will just never not be weird to have someone all up in my personal space bubble like that. I just find it awkward and that‚Äôs that. My sensory system hates it. Unfortunately it will probably drain all my good creative energy for the day so I‚Äôm not planning on any big projects for the day.</p>
<p><strong>Cancelled</strong> ‚Äî Well the dentist called and had to cancel because they don‚Äôt have any power. The flooding backed up more in town, and we had a windy storm last night. I guess more places lost power. What a mess.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 12:</strong> If you could swap lives with a fictional character for one day, who would it be?<br>
Maybe a Dr. Strange type person. If I could teleport and see a bunch of world landmarks in a day that would be so cool. And the power to control reality, yeah. I don‚Äôt love travel or sleeping in hotels so just a quick trip around the world for zero money. Seems like the best way to maximize one day of a borrowed life.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Phew no major rainfall last night. Just a short storm. Hopefully it didn‚Äôt make the flooding much worse. My aunt went to the Falls and apparently it stinks so bad they didn‚Äôt stop to look. How sad! And I‚Äôve seen countless people wading into it with their kids to play. Oh the bacteria of it all. Do they not watch the news or what? M. says the lake has receded a bit overnight so that‚Äôs good. We got sooo lucky. I‚Äôm so grateful. I may have lost a little sleep but not having to gut our basement or be trapped in our neighborhood is a wonderful blessing. Hopefully none of the roads I take to work got flooded!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 11: What's your most irrational fear that you know is silly, but still have?</strong><br>
No origin story but I‚Äôm terrified of walking behind people fishing. I have a fear that they‚Äôll swing back their pole to get the line out and it will instead catch on my face and hook me. It‚Äôs such a specific thing‚Ä¶ maybe I had a nightmare like that or something. I just do NOT want to walk near anyone that‚Äôs fishing at all.</p>
<p>Much later: Let‚Äôs all just agree that Bachelor in Paradise is a ridiculous show. I don‚Äôt know why hate-watching something feels so cathartic though?</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Wow last night we got over 10 inches of rain. The thunder was so loud I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep. Then around 3 a.m. our basement water alarms went off. Went to check it out and the sump pump was full. There was water leaking in from the walls and up from a crack in the floor (that I don‚Äôt think was there before). I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. There wasn‚Äôt much to do. We turned the sump pump off and on again and it started to work again. So it was hard to settle down for sleep after that but I eventually did! Our rivers are like 2 feet higher than ever in recorded history. I‚Äôm so glad it didn‚Äôt get worse in our basement! Lots of power outages but we kept ours. I‚Äôm sure the basement would have totally flooded without the sump pump. I wonder how our neighbors did?</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Backfill: I spent the whole day on a new project. I finally figured out an easy workflow. I put the code on GitHub as a repository and then open the code space to edit the code. From there I use a Live Server extension to test all my changes ‚Äî quick and easy in another browser window. I can even use my iPad, which is mainly what I use daily anywhere. I made lots of progress and figured out how to commit changes to Git as I went. I‚Äôm creating a super fun tool for anyone who wants to track their weather in a planner or journal.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm doing most of the code in JavaScript, which I‚Äôm honestly not super familiar with, but this project isn‚Äôt super complex ‚Äî it‚Äôs layout heavy. So it‚Äôs fun to learn as I go. The more I change, the more I understand it. I‚Äôm thinking I can make a few of the styles available free, then maybe add a one-time paid upgrade to unlock more themes and options. IDK ‚Äî I‚Äôve never sold a code project like this before. I‚Äôve made tools for myself, but if it breaks I can either abandon it or try to fix it. IDK if I‚Äôd be all that helpful in a ‚Äútech support‚Äù scenario. I‚Äôll just wait and see how I feel once it‚Äôs finished.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I had a terrible time trying to fall asleep last night. I just couldn‚Äôt relax. IDK if it‚Äôs dental appt anxiety or what, but that isn‚Äôt until next week. Terribly annoying. So I started today with a super relaxing bath. Just want to wash away the bad vibes. I think I‚Äôll take it kind of slow today. Might do some fun coding but nothing super taxing. I just don‚Äôt have a lot of extra mental resources right now. Plus I‚Äôve already released 2 new sticker sheets so far this month. That‚Äôs quite good for me!</p>
<p>Later: I got a terrible headache so the rest of the day was mostly a wash. I was trying to teach myself more code stuff. Then me and M. decided to go out for dinner and I realized my head hurt. It didn‚Äôt get worse though so I‚Äôm surviving‚Ä¶ just tired I guess. Yuck.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Yesterday was surprisingly productive. I designed, printed, and cut a whole new sticker sheet. Whoa! I eventually found the missing Apple Pencil and was inspired to make a sheet about clutter and disorganization. I love it! I just need to take product photos and then it can go live. Might be one of my fastest sheets ever with fresh artwork. Nothing is more inspiring than actual lived experience for me. I can feel if the message is being conveyed properly in my bones, I gotta remember to use that more often. It just feels good to process life through art that way. Like my life has more meaning than just something I experience alone.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 7: What's your personal &quot;comfy clothes&quot; uniform?</strong><br>
I never understood this growing up ‚Äî it felt like all clothes were the same comfort (except for tight jeans). Then I grew up, gained a little weight. Man, everything digs and pulls and feels weird! If I can go a whole day with no bra (or light bralette), pajama shirt, and sweatpants, I'm very happy. I always take off my ‚Äúoutside clothes‚Äù first thing when I'm home for the day now. It's sooo much better. Jeans are the worst.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I lost my Apple Pencil again and I can‚Äôt find it anywhere. I really wish the Magic Keyboard case had a secure spot for it. The magnet is totally unreliable. And it always hides once it falls off. It‚Äôs never just on the floor near the iPad or anything easy like that. And I don‚Äôt have the version with Find My device detection either.<br>
Plus I just have zero storage space to organize all my stuff. So that makes the search a lot more frustrating and difficult. Running a stationery shop out of your bedroom is NOT ideal.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 6: When was the last time you laughed so hard you couldn‚Äôt breathe?</strong><br>
Well I can remember a recent cry and laugh combo. I was talking about how I struggle to say yes to new things and new people. And they said ‚ÄúYour brain runs on binding contracts. Yes = now I‚Äôve agreed to coffee every month until one of us dies.‚Äù It sounds so silly and ridiculous but it resonated so hard that I just cried and laughed about the weirdness that is my brain. Like that‚Äôs obviously ridiculous‚Ä¶ a yes does not equal a lifetime contract, but for some reason that‚Äôs what I think.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Had a bit of an emotional day yesterday. Someone I used to work with came into work and told me some news, which wasn't a big deal in itself. It was just on the 40 min drive home while my mind wandered. I was just comparing my life and wondering why mine was so different‚Ä¶ wondering if I missed my chances‚Ä¶ wondering why some things just don't work out how you hope they would‚Ä¶ and so on. Just feeling overwhelmed by emotions in general. I think I just needed a good cry to reset and get it out. I know comparison is pointless and unhelpful. It just snuck up on me. I am still grieving various things and sometimes you just gotta get it out. I think I feel better today. I think I handled the emotions well and processed some stuff that was building up. Key takeaway: It's okay to feel old negative thoughts, but then be sure to let them go. You can't just DENY them away because you're &quot;not supposed&quot; to think them. Negative stuff just happens. Old brain programming doesn't just disappear overnight. Feel it, then reframe it and move on. I think sometimes you hear advice like &quot;comparison is the thief of joy,&quot; so then maybe you feel guilty when you accidentally compare yourself to others. But that's not helpful either. It's okay, and you can get through it.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Back to normal life today. Not getting too many boxes at work though so no major stress. Just the normal stress. My stomach was giving me some trouble last night. Not really sure why. I guess the pasta primavera was too creamy? Annoying. We are down to 2 episodes of <em>The Sandman</em> on Netflix. Not sure what else is left. This last episode felt like a finale.</p>
<p>Oh I got tags to work on my 11ty site. That‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs all a bit harder than I want it to be but then it wouldn‚Äôt feel quite as good when I finally figure something out. IDK what my final goal is with the project but it‚Äôs pretty fun (usually) to just play around with the layout and design for now. Plus it's a way to go back to any day in my planner even if I don‚Äôt have it sitting in front of me.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs a small hill you‚Äôre absolutely willing to die on?</strong><br>
Baths are better than showers. They take longer BUT shouldn‚Äôt resetting your body for a new day be a little more indulgent? Enjoyable? Peaceful? Relaxing? I can‚Äôt even hear my music in a shower. Plus I just don‚Äôt feel as deeply clean. Showers work in a pinch or a rush. But the full bath is where the real body reset happens.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>M comes back from visiting J today. Yay! Back to normal. I ended up finishing my Annual Holidays sticker sheets yesterday. I even got them listed. But by dinner my brain was melted and I struggled a lot to make myself food. So a productive day followed by a crash. I guess that makes sense even if I find it very annoying.<br>
Today is just a personal prep day. Not gonna do any shop work. I‚Äôm listening to my body and it was shouting for rest.</p>
<p>M. came back! All's right with the world. I missed her a lot this time. My whole routine felt a bit off and weird. I couldn't figure out quite how to spend my evenings. I watched some totally random movies I don‚Äôt even remember now. She's like my anchor. Even when my ADHD wants me to go wild I stick to more of a schedule when she's around. It's just easier to relax and unwind too. I had a really hard time falling asleep both nights she was gone. All is well for now though. Phew! I could use a little more shut eye tonight- back to work tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 3: What‚Äôs the weirdest snack combo you genuinely enjoy?</strong><br>
I‚Äôm not sure I eat any weird combos. I like my food simple. I‚Äôm not an adventurous food person. Usually if someone finds a choice I make weird, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs very bland. Like no ketchup or anything on fries or a hot dog. IDK, I‚Äôm not big on condiments.</p>

<p>The Hobonichi theme for 2026 is ‚ÄúYou Love You‚Äù! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Well, do you? I can‚Äôt wait to see what covers and visual themes they have. Even though I‚Äôll probably just keep my same A5 Avec that I did this year. And I splurged on my cover by POTR so it would be wise to use it again unless they release the best design ever.</p>
<p>My lungs are tired from the low air quality yesterday. My Fitbit says my SpO2 overnight was 91% even though I didn‚Äôt do anything strenuous. I feel okay though. My mind is a lot clearer. I‚Äôve already cut half of the holiday stickers and done the accounting.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll only do a little more shop work then try to wrap it up. Maybe do some social media stuff.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 2: If you had to give your current mood a weather report, what would it be?</strong><br>
Maybe partly cloudy, comfortable temps with an early sunset. Haha! Does that make sense? I‚Äôm a tiny bit tired thus a few clouds. But otherwise comfortable ‚Äî no big stressors currently. And since it‚Äôs the weekend I‚Äôll wrap things up early with ‚Äúsunset.‚Äù Overall pretty good!</p>

<p>Finally a free day with super nice weather! Ah! Yay! It had been too long. I went to my favorite beach for guaranteed fun and rocks to look at. The waves were big-ish but the absolute perfect temperature. The breeze was perfect. I didn‚Äôt notice the air quality feeling smokey either. You could see it if you looked far enough away though. Lots of people there and a few other rock hunters. Nothing spectacular found but I did get a piece of sea glass‚Ä¶ my 2nd or 3rd piece ever. Just clear in color but still exciting to me anyway. I feel so relieved I finally got some sun and air.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Last work day of the month. I feel like July was both fast and slow. I hated all the heat and humidity. I just stayed inside the whole month. It was miserable. We had one or two good days and I was busy with work for both. No idea what August will hold but it‚Äôs typically a hot and humid one too. This whole weekend should be way nicer though so I‚Äôm gonna go to a beach at least once. I‚Äôm going stir crazy inside.</p>
<p>I spent all day yesterday comparing my Eleventy site to my Grow site. I‚Äôm not sure which I like better. Cloudflare kept injecting extra code into my 11ty site and breaking the footer. So I turned it off for that subdomain. But I do hate the manual FTP process. Maybe I need different software? It‚Äôs just slow for even tiny files. Maybe I should FTP right from VS Code itself instead of using Forklift? Apparently my hosting isn‚Äôt compatible with the more modern tools (like GitHub) so it just slows everything down. Maybe I should consider switching hosting companies? This one‚Äôs affordable and I‚Äôve used them forever. Migrating servers always becomes a nightmare. All the databases and DNS and subdomains and emails and all the custom rules and logins. It always sucks‚Ä¶</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Taking today to just work on fun stuff and relax. I played with some web coding and I‚Äôll work on my crochet more later. The yarn keeps rubbing my finger and irritating it though. They make ‚Äúthimble tape‚Äù to protect fingers. It sticks to itself so it‚Äôs not as messy as a band-aid. So glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one who was bothered by such a thing.</p>
<p>I thought I was being ‚Äúoverly sensitive‚Äù maybe. But I need to stop thinking that. It‚Äôs not helpful. If I‚Äôm uncomfortable then that‚Äôs just the truth. No use trying to deny my reality anymore. I‚Äôve got to trust my feelings and instincts a little more. Not gaslight myself.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 30: How do you like to get ready for a new month‚Äîany little rituals or habits?</strong><br>
Just by filling out my monthly spread in my planner. I can see all the appointments and obligations at a glance and get a sense of the kind of month ahead. It‚Äôs also just a good time to start wrapping up the current month in my mind. Check to see what I all accomplished. I write down every little success and win so I don‚Äôt forget. I struggle to think of time accurately and I often forget what really happened in a month so it‚Äôs really helpful to review.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Stuck in wait mode because I have an appointment later today. I don‚Äôt want to start anything because then I‚Äôll have to stop. And I always lose track of time if I‚Äôm doing anything remotely interesting. So instead I doom scroll. I guess it‚Äôs both an ADHD thing and an autism thing. Fun. /sarcasm</p>
<p>I was reading some of my super old blog posts from 2008‚Äì2010 last night. I swear I don‚Äôt remember at least half of what I talk about. It‚Äôs kind of weird. Like a whole different person wrote them. Also the absolute chaotic OBVIOUSLY ADHD tone is wild to me. I thought I was being coherent? I switch subjects every 2 sentences with zero segue. I still do that but I‚Äôm aware of it. Who even was I as a teen? The mood swings of it all. I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôm older now. Some thoughts actually have space around them.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 29: What‚Äôs a summer activity that always makes you feel like yourself?</strong><br>
Hah well staying indoors in the A/C is a very me thing to do. And it‚Äôs been hot so I‚Äôve been very much me. But lately, if I can go to a beach and look at rocks I feel much more grounded and present. A simple task to keep my mind occupied but also peaceful.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Another summer day, another heat advisory. Over it! Anyways I got caught up on life yesterday. Ready for this week and the next month too. I did troubleshoot my holiday sticker sheet again yesterday. I made every mistake possible. Also the stickers weren‚Äôt sized for my Hobonichi at all‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what my poor brain was thinking when I started working on it. But I think the design is finished anyways. I guess I‚Äôll sell a small version since I made all the files anyway. I never know what planners my customers use outside of Hobonichi so it can‚Äôt hurt. It should be a nice year round and end of year product to have. I hope it‚Äôs well liked for all the headaches it has caused me.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 28: What‚Äôs one small thing that made you smile this week?</strong><br>
I got new stickers from TheCoffeeMonsterzCo in the mail. That‚Äôs always a happy day. New stickers are the best. New ways to express myself in my planner. Also someone on social media asked about my planner and said she wanted to start one. I‚Äôm so glad I could inspire someone to try something new. My planner brings me so much peace and joy. So I‚Äôm very happy to share that.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I realized I made a HUGE mistake yesterday. I worked on the art for my holidays sticker sheet all day. When I went to export, I realized the image was half the size it was supposed to be. But I did do it at 600 DPI. So I attempted to resize it a few ways. Most looked terrible, except one: manually copying layers a few at a time and transforming the scale to 200%. It was tedious but the art doesn't look too awful. I'll have to do a test print to see if it's visible at the final size. Otherwise, I need to redraw 33 stickers' worth of art. (I REALLY hope it looks okay!)<br>
It happened because I changed the DPI on the file from 300 to 600 and Procreate decided I had too many layers, so it shrank the canvas size without telling me. It‚Äôs just a complex sticker sheet so it had lots of layers.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 27: What's something you're pretty good at that could help you this month?</strong><br>
I think problem solving in general. I'm tenacious when I try to do something I want to do. When I hit speedbumps I get stubborn and keep figuring stuff out... usually. Like this cursed sticker sheet that is testing ALL of my skills.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I had a really good day yesterday. It was really balanced between shop work and good self care. I restocked some products. I stuffed envelopes for future orders. I even got a little bit more caught up on social media. All important stuff. Then worked on crochet in the evening. I‚Äôm making good progress on the body... it‚Äôs gonna be so cute!<br>
We started watching part two of the final season of <em>The Sandman</em>. I think I might read the comics once we‚Äôre done. I like the whole universe. It‚Äôs a cool/unique vibe and idea. I like all the mythology it pulls from too.<br>
Today I‚Äôm working on my holidays sticker sheet. Lots of little icons to design. I think I prefer working larger. Details make me happy. But it‚Äôs an important product to have so I don‚Äôt mind that much.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 26: What‚Äôs your favorite way to enjoy being outside in summer‚Äîbeach, shade, bugs, snacks?</strong><br>
I‚Äôve come to love the beach. Before I started beachcombing and rock hunting I didn‚Äôt appreciate it much. Now I love it. My new favorite way to spend a summer day. I‚Äôm not big on swimming, so now it‚Äôs more of an activity that holds my attention.</p>
