<blockquote>
<p>Although the former postman was regarded by some townspeople as a scowling, cantankerous oaf, he was beloved by neighborhood children, to whom he would regularly hand out butterscotch candies from his front stoop with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I took yesterday totally off of anything even remotely productive. I just played a word game on my iPad and watched a movie. Then we watched the 4th of July fireworks from my bedroom. It was a full day off. I only felt a little guilty overall.</p>
<p>Back to normal life now though. I have to do laundry and get some things done for the shop. I have a custom order I need to work on and I need to stock up the Q3 freebie sticker sheet. Maybe I could do some kind of long form video for YouTube again. Go over my planner pages from Q2. Although I hate to turn off my fan on a hot day like today, but it's terribly loud and totally ruins any audio.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 5: When‚Äôs the last time you did something a little out of your comfort zone‚Äîmaybe something summery or spontaneous?</strong><br>
Maybe when I went to the botanical gardens. It's a bit of a drive so I usually only go once a year. But I wanted to see the peonies before they all fell down. I pushed myself to make the plan and go‚Äîeven though the weather wasn‚Äôt ideal (a bit hot and smoky).</p>
<p>Oh nooo! I put my phone in the washing machine with the laundry. I got it out in a couple of minutes but I turned it off and surrounded it with silica packets just in case. Doh!</p>
