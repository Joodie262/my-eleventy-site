<p>It wasn‚Äôt too hot to function outside today! Yay!! I went for a walk with M. at a local park. The sun was warm, and there was a nice breeze. We did get attacked by mosquitos in some parts though, which was awful. Totally ruins the peaceful nature vibe. I hate them so much. I may stick to beach-only outdoor trips until we get a first frost here. The flooding probably made them a lot worse. Also there‚Äôs still a huge pile of flooding trash in our whole neighborhood. But we got an email that everything was picked up. That‚Äôs going to be a problem!</p>

<p><strong>Prompt 24: Which fictional universe would you happily retire in?</strong><br>
I‚Äôm trying to think of a magical world that isn‚Äôt super dangerous. The faerie world in the Emily Wilde books sounded fun (but not if they abduct me or anything). I haven‚Äôt read a lot of fiction where the world is much better than the real one. If it was a perfect world it wouldn‚Äôt make an interesting story. I don‚Äôt think I read or watch the right things to answer this one.</p>
<p>Ah I thought of one: <em>Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service</em>. Just chill lite-witch vibes. No big scaries. Just a hint of magic in a cozy seaside town. But I‚Äôd have a little doggy friend instead of a cat. Sorry cats‚Äîyou make me sneeze!</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Hello to the weekend. I feel torn on Saturdays between doing shop work and doing a more traditional off-work weekend. I could go either way. I have some momentum going from yesterday. I don‚Äôt often finalize art, go through all the steps and list a product all in one day. I did reorganize my inventory storage yesterday so now I have room for more sticker sheets. I have a lot of my basic functional sheets that continue to sell well. But I‚Äôm having more fun with decorative and Cookie character stickers. I feel like you need a lot to choose from to really enjoy a new character in your planner, so I‚Äôm just slowly building up Cookie‚Äôs Collection. I hope I‚Äôm right about that. My recent Cousin kit sells well too. Those take weeks to finalize the art for though, so it‚Äôs harder to start new ones.</p>
<p>Later‚Ä¶ I changed my sticker sheet pricing finally. I did some research into ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù and I realized I was under-pricing my work. I kept prices lower on my Shopify because there are less fees on each order. I hope everyone is okay with it. I just haven‚Äôt yet made enough to cover material costs, so hopefully this will help bridge that gap. Also updated my shop theme to the latest version. Yay!</p>

<p>I think today will be a design day. Somehow I feel like I‚Äôm already behind for Halloween even though it‚Äôs August. I am running out of room in my inventory containers for sticker sheets.

<p>Later‚Ä¶ Well I finished, photographed and listed a Halloween Cookie sticker sheet. Woo. Lots of work but glad I have something for the upcoming spooky season.

<p><strong>Prompt 22: What‚Äôs the weirdest compliment you‚Äôve ever received?</strong><br>
The first one that comes to mind would be one I got in high school from a ‚Äúgoth kid‚Äù who said I‚Äôd make a really good ‚Äúgoth‚Äù because my skin was so pale. Haha.

<p>Ugh a medical anxiety day. My stomach is in knots. I‚Äôm trying to stay calm but the dentist will just never be my favorite thing. I‚Äôve actually gotten pretty lucky with my teeth. Only ever had one cavity. And I did have to get 4 wisdom teeth removed but that‚Äôs it. So I really have nothing to realistically be anxious about. It‚Äôs just the invasion of personal space and interacting like a normal human under the stress. No use not going to the dentist because then it would just be for a big problem somewhere down the line. I‚Äôll be an adult today‚Ä¶</p>
<p><strong>Later</strong> All done being an adult. Zero troubles. Got my X-rays. I went to our local fancy grocery store to look for a treat and I found my fav iced butter cookies. So that was my little reward for being a champ. Tomorrow I‚Äôll do more ‚Äúproductive‚Äù things but just trying to deal with the anxiety was enough for today.</p>
<p>Oh I got to see the full 2026 Hobo lineup this evening. None of the covers are screaming ‚Äúmust buy‚Äù but when I start seeing real people hold them I might change my mind. There is one plaid shirt fabric one that I might get. I might have to go for a cover/book combo if I want one at all since you can‚Äôt buy the covers alone for some reason. I do want those index tabs though‚Ä¶ I think.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve got some shop stuff to finalize today: inventory for the 2026 calendars and the Etsy and TikTok listings. If I feel super energetic I‚Äôd like to keep drawing my Halloween sheet too.

<p>Later: I got some decent work done but also sprinkled in my fun HTML website coding so I wouldn‚Äôt get too tired of cutting stickers. The calendars are live. I also picked up an Rx I need for tomorrow. It was a good day. Tomorrow I‚Äôll probably be mentally fatigued, so again no huge projects planned. Gotta do as much self care as I can.

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I have off work this Thursday due to my dentist appointment getting rescheduled so yesterday was my only day this week. Woo! I think I'll work on a Halloween sticker sheet and get that finished this week. I got my biggest order of sticker paper yesterday. I believe this shop is going to pick up steam, so I‚Äôm increasing how much I keep in stock. Should make the busy season a little easier on me. I hope. I need to finish listing the 2026 calendars too, stalled out at the photography phase.</p>
<p><strong>Later</strong> ‚Äî Okay, I took some photos and listed them on my website‚Ä¶ only to realize I didn‚Äôt actually cut any inventory for 2 of 3 sizes. Wow brain! Whoops. So I cut some and I‚Äôll finish the rest tomorrow. I swear I‚Äôm running on brain fumes lately. I kind of wish I could take a month off for a sort of resting vacation. I‚Äôll do okay for a day or two, and then my energy just completely tanks out. I hope I don‚Äôt go full burnout mode. I‚Äôm trying to pace myself but doing it all alone just means stuff HAS to get done whether I have energy for it or not. Running a whole business requires a constant shifting of roles and usually that‚Äôs what makes it fun for me. But when I‚Äôm tired it just means all areas can suffer equally.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep for an hour. Those types of nights totally ruin my mood. I hate wondering: will I get back to sleep or will I just lay here doing nothing until morning comes? It‚Äôs probably largely because I ate a brownie after dinner. Too indulgent and my stomach said no. But when life offers you a brownie you gotta take it! lol.</p>
<p>Anyways I did take it easy yesterday but ended up with a headache anyway. I drew 3 stickers and then I told myself to stop so I could rest. I guess that was too much. Me and my body lately‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt just get along I guess.</p>

<p>Yesterday was surprisingly productive. I‚Äôm going to take it easy today. I really had 3 really focused days in a row. Which is very unusual for me. Maybe I‚Äôm getting excited because Hobonichi reveals their 2026 planners every day on social media. So I‚Äôm thinking about the future!

<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 17: What‚Äôs the most recent piece of advice you‚Äôve completely ignored?</strong><br>
Kind of hard to think of any. If I feel like certain advice isn‚Äôt right for me, I think I just mentally trash it after I hear it. Otherwise I just feel guilty. I guess I heard that if you have pale skin you should really be getting your skin checked regularly with a dermatologist. I‚Äôm still planning to make an appointment but I just don‚Äôt know logistically how to make the appointment and make sure it‚Äôs covered by insurance. So I‚Äôm procrastinated because ADHD makes it feel like too many steps. So it‚Äôs advice I will eventually get to but for now it‚Äôs getting ignored.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Yesterday was a good day. I hadn‚Äôt planned on designing 3 whole sticker sheets but it worked out. I‚Äôm still stuck, unable to use Adobe Illustrator when I‚Äôm cutting stickers but the calendars get started in Affinity Publisher so I could actually do design and cutting at the same time. Like I used to be able to. I really, really need a laptop so I can overcome that software glitch in the future.  It‚Äôs incredibly slowing to my whole work process. I cannot believe they haven‚Äôt fixed it yet either. I might have to figure out a stopgap workflow in Affinity Designer for awhile. I just don‚Äôt know if it has all the path tools I need like offset, simplify, smooth, etc.<br>
Very HIGH energy and productive day!</p>
<p>TCMC subscription arrived and I organized my whole sticker collection in binders. Yay!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 16: If you were a candle scent, what would be in your blend?</strong><br>
Well, I think I‚Äôd mostly have something sweet like vanilla. I‚Äôm generally a kind/sweet person with a big heart. Maybe some cinnamon for my neurospicy nature. I lean towards intensity when I do have emotions tho so maybe a hint of something stronger. I‚Äôm no fragrance expert. Maybe amber for the drama and some complexity.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Spent the day working on stuff for the shop. Got to work right away restocking low products. Then I was thinking about my next product and remembered I need to make 2026 calendar stickers for the Hobonichi planners. Took me awhile to remember how I did it last year so I documented the process this time in my Obsidian notes. Should be pretty quick from here on out. I‚Äôm just proofing them now and I should be able to get them listed this weekend. Yay! I still need to keep restocking lots of staple items and stuff some more envelopes for Q3 when I get a chance.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 15: What‚Äôs your most-used emoji, and does it fit your actual personality?</strong><br>
Mine is the blushing, smiling emoji surrounded by 3 little hearts. I think it fits me well because I do feel that way a lot. It‚Äôs like the ‚Äúawww‚Äù emoji to me. I find a lot of things cute or adorable or I‚Äôm thankful in that way. I‚Äôm glad it wasn‚Äôt an LOL emoji cuz I rarely laugh that hard like that.</p>
