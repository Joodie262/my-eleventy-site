<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Wow last night we got over 10 inches of rain. The thunder was so loud I couldn’t fall asleep. Then around 3 a.m. our basement water alarms went off. Went to check it out and the sump pump was full. There was water leaking in from the walls and up from a crack in the floor (that I don’t think was there before). I’ve never seen anything like it. There wasn’t much to do. We turned the sump pump off and on again and it started to work again. So it was hard to settle down for sleep after that but I eventually did! Our rivers are like 2 feet higher than ever in recorded history. I’m so glad it didn’t get worse in our basement! Lots of power outages but we kept ours. I’m sure the basement would have totally flooded without the sump pump. I wonder how our neighbors did?</p>

<li>Set Fire to the Rain — Adele</li>

<li>Up All Night — Owl City (’Cuz floods and rain and I’m tired.)</li>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Backfill: I spent the whole day on a new project. I finally figured out an easy workflow. I put the code on GitHub as a repository and then open the code space to edit the code. From there I use a Live Server extension to test all my changes — quick and easy in another browser window. I can even use my iPad, which is mainly what I use daily anywhere. I made lots of progress and figured out how to commit changes to Git as I went. I’m creating a super fun tool for anyone who wants to track their weather in a planner or journal.</p>
<p>I’m doing most of the code in JavaScript, which I’m honestly not super familiar with, but this project isn’t super complex — it’s layout heavy. So it’s fun to learn as I go. The more I change, the more I understand it. I’m thinking I can make a few of the styles available free, then maybe add a one-time paid upgrade to unlock more themes and options. IDK — I’ve never sold a code project like this before. I’ve made tools for myself, but if it breaks I can either abandon it or try to fix it. IDK if I’d be all that helpful in a “tech support” scenario. I’ll just wait and see how I feel once it’s finished.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I had a terrible time trying to fall asleep last night. I just couldn’t relax. IDK if it’s dental appt anxiety or what, but that isn’t until next week. Terribly annoying. So I started today with a super relaxing bath. Just want to wash away the bad vibes. I think I’ll take it kind of slow today. Might do some fun coding but nothing super taxing. I just don’t have a lot of extra mental resources right now. Plus I’ve already released 2 new sticker sheets so far this month. That’s quite good for me!</p>
<p>Later: I got a terrible headache so the rest of the day was mostly a wash. I was trying to teach myself more code stuff. Then me and M. decided to go out for dinner and I realized my head hurt. It didn’t get worse though so I’m surviving… just tired I guess. Yuck.</p>

<p>Yesterday was surprisingly productive. I designed, printed, and cut a whole new sticker sheet. Whoa! I eventually found the missing Apple Pencil and was inspired to make a sheet about clutter and disorganization. I love it! I just need to take product photos and then it can go live. Might be one of my fastest sheets ever with fresh artwork. Nothing is more inspiring than actual lived experience for me. I can feel if the message is being conveyed properly in my bones, I gotta remember to use that more often. It just feels good to process life through art that way.

<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 7: What's your personal &quot;comfy clothes&quot; uniform?</strong><br>
I never understood this growing up — it felt like all clothes were the same comfort (except for tight jeans). Then I grew up, gained a little weight. Man, everything digs and pulls and feels weird! If I can go a whole day with no bra (or light bralette), pajama shirt, and sweatpants, I'm very happy. I always take off my “outside clothes” first thing when I'm home for the day now. It's sooo much better. Jeans are the worst.</p>

<p>I lost my Apple Pencil again and I can’t find it anywhere. I really wish the Magic Keyboard case had a secure spot for it. The magnet is totally unreliable. And it always hides once it falls off. It’s never just on the floor near the iPad or anything easy like that. And I don’t have the version with Find My device detection either.<br>

<p><strong>Prompt 6: When was the last time you laughed so hard you couldn’t breathe?</strong><br>
Well I can remember a recent cry and laugh combo. I was talking about how I struggle to say yes to new things and new people. And they said “Your brain runs on binding contracts. Yes = now I’ve agreed to coffee every month until one of us dies.” It sounds so silly and ridiculous but it resonated so hard that I just cried and laughed about the weirdness that is my brain. Like that’s obviously ridiculous… a yes does not equal a lifetime contract, but for some reason that’s what I think.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Had a bit of an emotional day yesterday. Someone I used to work with came into work and told me some news, which wasn't a big deal in itself. It was just on the 40 min drive home while my mind wandered. I was just comparing my life and wondering why mine was so different… wondering if I missed my chances… wondering why some things just don't work out how you hope they would… and so on. Just feeling overwhelmed by emotions in general. I think I just needed a good cry to reset and get it out. I know comparison is pointless and unhelpful. It just snuck up on me. I am still grieving various things and sometimes you just gotta get it out. I think I feel better today. I think I handled the emotions well and processed some stuff that was building up. Key takeaway: It's okay to feel old negative thoughts, but then be sure to let them go. You can't just DENY them away because you're &quot;not supposed&quot; to think them. Negative stuff just happens. Old brain programming doesn't just disappear overnight. Feel it, then reframe it and move on. I think sometimes you hear advice like &quot;comparison is the thief of joy,&quot; so then maybe you feel guilty when you accidentally compare yourself to others. But that's not helpful either. It's okay, and you can get through it.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Back to normal life today. Not getting too many boxes at work though so no major stress. Just the normal stress. My stomach was giving me some trouble last night. Not really sure why. I guess the pasta primavera was too creamy? Annoying. We are down to 2 episodes of <em>The Sandman</em> on Netflix. Not sure what else is left. This last episode felt like a finale.</p>
<p>Oh I got tags to work on my 11ty site. That’s fun. It’s all a bit harder than I want it to be but then it wouldn’t feel quite as good when I finally figure something out. IDK what my final goal is with the project but it’s pretty fun (usually) to just play around with the layout and design for now. Plus it's a way to go back to any day in my planner even if I don’t have it sitting in front of me.</p>

<p><strong>What’s a small hill you’re absolutely willing to die on?</strong><br>
Baths are better than showers. They take longer BUT shouldn’t resetting your body for a new day be a little more indulgent? Enjoyable? Peaceful? Relaxing? I can’t even hear my music in a shower. Plus I just don’t feel as deeply clean. Showers work in a pinch or a rush. But the full bath is where the real body reset happens.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>M comes back from visiting J today. Yay! Back to normal. I ended up finishing my Annual Holidays sticker sheets yesterday. I even got them listed. But by dinner my brain was melted and I struggled a lot to make myself food. So a productive day followed by a crash. I guess that makes sense even if I find it very annoying.<br>
Today is just a personal prep day. Not gonna do any shop work. I’m listening to my body and it was shouting for rest.</p>
<p>M. came back! All's right with the world. I missed her a lot this time. My whole routine felt a bit off and weird. I couldn't figure out quite how to spend my evenings. I watched some totally random movies I don’t even remember now. She's like my anchor. Even when my ADHD wants me to go wild I stick to more of a schedule when she's around. It's just easier to relax and unwind too. I had a really hard time falling asleep both nights she was gone. All is well for now though. Phew! I could use a little more shut eye tonight- back to work tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 3: What’s the weirdest snack combo you genuinely enjoy?</strong><br>
I’m not sure I eat any weird combos. I like my food simple. I’m not an adventurous food person. Usually if someone finds a choice I make weird, it’s because it’s very bland. Like no ketchup or anything on fries or a hot dog. IDK, I’m not big on condiments.</p>

<li><strong>extended use</strong>: refers to something that has usually diverse layers or aspects apparent beneath the surface</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Scholars believe the motive for making palimpsests was often economic — reusing parchment was cheaper than preparing a new skin.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>The Hobonichi theme for 2026 is “You Love You”! ☺️ Well, do you? I can’t wait to see what covers and visual themes they have. Even though I’ll probably just keep my same A5 Avec that I did this year. And I splurged on my cover by POTR so it would be wise to use it again unless they release the best design ever.</p>
<p>My lungs are tired from the low air quality yesterday. My Fitbit says my SpO2 overnight was 91% even though I didn’t do anything strenuous. I feel okay though. My mind is a lot clearer. I’ve already cut half of the holiday stickers and done the accounting.</p>
<p>I’ll only do a little more shop work then try to wrap it up. Maybe do some social media stuff.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 2: If you had to give your current mood a weather report, what would it be?</strong><br>
Maybe partly cloudy, comfortable temps with an early sunset. Haha! Does that make sense? I’m a tiny bit tired thus a few clouds. But otherwise comfortable — no big stressors currently. And since it’s the weekend I’ll wrap things up early with “sunset.” Overall pretty good!</p>

<li><strong>original use</strong>: refers to writing material used one or more times after earlier writing has been erased; the underlying text is &quot;in palimpsest&quot;</li>
<li><strong>extended use</strong>: refers to something that has usually diverse layers or aspects apparent beneath the surface</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Scholars believe the motive for making palimpsests was often economic — reusing parchment was cheaper than preparing a new skin.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>The Hobonichi theme for 2026 is “You Love You”! ☺️ Well, do you? I can’t wait to see what covers and visual themes they have. Even though I’ll probably just keep my same A5 Avec that I did this year. And I splurged on my cover by POTR so it would be wise to use it again unless they release the best design ever.</p>
<p>My lungs are tired from the low air quality yesterday. My Fitbit says my SpO2 overnight was 91% even though I didn’t do anything strenuous. I feel okay though. My mind is a lot clearer. I’ve already cut half of the holiday stickers and done the accounting.</p>
<p>I’ll only do a little more shop work then try to wrap it up. Maybe do some social media stuff.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 2: If you had to give your current mood a weather report, what would it be?</strong><br>
Maybe partly cloudy, comfortable temps with an early sunset. Haha! Does that make sense? I’m a tiny bit tired thus a few clouds. But otherwise comfortable — no big stressors currently. And since it’s the weekend I’ll wrap things up early with “sunset.” Overall pretty good!</p>
<h2>📌 Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Great sleep</strong></li>
<li>⚠️ <strong>Missed habits</strong>: sm post, yoga/movement</li>
<li>✅ <strong>All tasks completed</strong></li>
<li>✨ <strong>Mood</strong>: comfortable but a little tired</li>

<p>Finally a free day with super nice weather! Ah! Yay! It had been too long. I went to my favorite beach for guaranteed fun and rocks to look at. The waves were big-ish but the absolute perfect temperature. The breeze was perfect. I didn’t notice the air quality feeling smokey either. You could see it if you looked far enough away though. Lots of people there and a few other rock hunters. Nothing spectacular found but I did get a piece of sea glass… my 2nd or 3rd piece ever. Just clear in color but still exciting to me anyway. I feel so relieved I finally got some sun and air.</p>

<p>Oh! I saw 4 sandhill cranes today and a deer. The other day after work I saw a mom and baby deer cross the road. So cute!</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 1: What’s the last app you opened on your phone and why?</strong><br>
Well before Safari—to get this prompt from my website—I think it was Messages to read a text from my mom. We were just talking about some random stuff to buy from Target. Thrilling!</p>
