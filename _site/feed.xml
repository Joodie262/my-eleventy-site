<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>I'm changing my daily habit from social media post to self-care. I'm pretty burnt out on social media so it's just not going to be a daily priority for me anymore. I'd rather work directly on my business designing new products. Those will last and add value for a lot longer than anything I put on social media anyway.</p>
<p>Last night it took me hours to fall asleep. My dental cleaning got cancelled so I think I had saved up energy for that. Then it had nowhere to go. So‚Äîinsomnia. Not all that surprising, but frustrating anyway. Maybe I'll cut a few sticker sheets to feel productive today, or work on my special app thing for Hobonichi planners. Not sure yet, but coding does seem to have my heart lately.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt 13: What's your current &quot;comfort rewatch&quot; TV show, movie, or YT channel?</strong><br>
Right now I'm watching &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; but I don't know how far I'll get. It's not an ultimate favorite, but it reminds me of nostalgic fashion and high school drama. I watch old TCMC videos from Helen if I want something cozy and very chill. A classic rewatch is &quot;Supernatural&quot; for me. I've watched it many times!</p>

<p>Ugh I have to be an adult today and take care of my body for future me. Present day me is annoyed. I know lots of people don‚Äôt like the dentist and try to be mature about it.

<p>Phew no major rainfall last night. Just a short storm. Hopefully it didn‚Äôt make the flooding much worse. My aunt went to the Falls and apparently it stinks so bad they didn‚Äôt stop to look. How sad! And I‚Äôve seen countless people wading into it with their kids to play. Oh the bacteria of it all. Do they not watch the news or what? M. says the lake has receded a bit overnight so that‚Äôs good. We got sooo lucky. I‚Äôm so grateful.

<p>Much later: Let‚Äôs all just agree that Bachelor in Paradise is a ridiculous show. I don‚Äôt know why hate-watching something feels so cathartic though?</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Wow last night we got over 10 inches of rain. The thunder was so loud I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep. Then around 3 a.m. our basement water alarms went off. Went to check it out and the sump pump was full. There was water leaking in from the walls and up from a crack in the floor (that I don‚Äôt think was there before). I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. There wasn‚Äôt much to do. We turned the sump pump off and on again and it started to work again. So it was hard to settle down for sleep after that but I eventually did! Our rivers are like 2 feet higher than ever in recorded history. I‚Äôm so glad it didn‚Äôt get worse in our basement! Lots of power outages but we kept ours. I‚Äôm sure the basement would have totally flooded without the sump pump. I wonder how our neighbors did?</p>

<p>Yesterday was surprisingly productive. I designed, printed, and cut a whole new sticker sheet. Whoa!

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Had a bit of an emotional day yesterday. Someone I used to work with came into work and told me some news, which wasn't a big deal in itself. It was just on the 40 min drive home while my mind wandered. I was just comparing my life and wondering why mine was so different‚Ä¶ wondering if I missed my chances‚Ä¶ wondering why some things just don't work out how you hope they would‚Ä¶ and so on. Just feeling overwhelmed by emotions in general. I think I just needed a good cry to reset and get it out. I know comparison is pointless and unhelpful. It just snuck up on me. I am still grieving various things and sometimes you just gotta get it out. I think I feel better today. I think I handled the emotions well and processed some stuff that was building up. Key takeaway: It's okay to feel old negative thoughts, but then be sure to let them go. You can't just DENY them away because you're &quot;not supposed&quot; to think them. Negative stuff just happens. Old brain programming doesn't just disappear overnight. Feel it, then reframe it and move on. I think sometimes you hear advice like &quot;comparison is the thief of joy,&quot; so then maybe you feel guilty when you accidentally compare yourself to others. But that's not helpful either. It's okay, and you can get through it.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Had a bit of an emotional day yesterday. Someone I used to work with came into work and told me some news, which wasn't a big deal in itself. It was just on the 40 min drive home while my mind wandered. I was just comparing my life and wondering why mine was so different‚Ä¶ wondering if I missed my chances‚Ä¶ wondering why some things just don't work out how you hope they would‚Ä¶ and so on. Just feeling overwhelmed by emotions in general. I think I just needed a good cry to reset and get it out. I know comparison is pointless and unhelpful. It just snuck up on me. I am still grieving various things and sometimes you just gotta get it out. I think I feel better today. I think I handled the emotions well and processed some stuff that was building up. Key takeaway: It's okay to feel old negative thoughts, but then be sure to let them go. You can't just DENY them away because you're &quot;not supposed&quot; to think them. Negative stuff just happens. Old brain programming doesn't just disappear overnight. Feel it, then reframe it and move on. I think sometimes you hear advice like &quot;comparison is the thief of joy,&quot; so then maybe you feel guilty when you accidentally compare yourself to others. But that's not helpful either. It's okay, and you can get through it.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>
<p>Back to normal life today. Not getting too many boxes at work though so no major stress. Just the normal stress. My stomach was giving me some trouble last night. Not really sure why. I guess the pasta primavera was too creamy? Annoying. We are down to 2 episodes of <em>The Sandman</em> on Netflix. Not sure what else is left. This last episode felt like a finale.</p>
<p>Oh I got tags to work on my 11ty site. That‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs all a bit harder than I want it to be but then it wouldn‚Äôt feel quite as good when I finally figure something out. IDK what my final goal is with the project but it‚Äôs pretty fun (usually) to just play around with the layout and design for now. Plus it's a way to go back to any day in my planner even if I don‚Äôt have it sitting in front of me.</p>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs a small hill you‚Äôre absolutely willing to die on?</strong><br>
Baths are better than showers. They take longer BUT shouldn‚Äôt resetting your body for a new day be a little more indulgent? Enjoyable? Peaceful? Relaxing? I can‚Äôt even hear my music in a shower. Plus I just don‚Äôt feel as deeply clean. Showers work in a pinch or a rush. But the full bath is where the real body reset happens.</p>
