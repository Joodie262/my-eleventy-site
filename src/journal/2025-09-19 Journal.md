## Journal
Hello Friday! Work was kind of a bummer yesterday. I don’t have room for anything so it’s not satisfying to finish up. It’s just technically “done” but not good in my eyes. It’s becoming very disheartening and I dunno how to turn my attitude about it around. It’s also just physically exhausting every single time. I think the satisfaction of having done a good job used to push me through. Now I just barely survive. And now I need to pivot to my shop today even though I’d love to just rest and recover. What’s that saying? Burning the candle at both ends. Yeah. That’s me lately.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 19: What’s a sound, flavor, or texture that grounds you?**  
I’ve come to really love white noise. Always helps me fall asleep now. Even at work if there’s a heavy downpour of rain it sounds like white noise and it’s like I can breathe again. Ice cold water can be similar. Refreshing and like a little reset button on the senses. A strong cool breeze. Haha maybe if I just lived near a mountain waterfall I’d be grounded all the time?
