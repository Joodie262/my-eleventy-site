## Journal
M. got me donuts for breakfast! Yummy! Haven’t done that in forever. I finished watching season 2 of *The Lazarus Project* last night. It’s a good show. If there is another season, I know I’m going to have to rewatch this one though. Time travel makes for a confusing plot!  

Yesterday was very productive, so I don’t know what I should do today. More work? Or more chill? I’m not very good at gauging how much energy I’m going to have on any given day. I guess I just fly by the seat of my pants most days.  

I think I’ve already released 4 new sticker sheets just this month so far. Maybe it should be an “off” day to recharge.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 13: What household chore do you secretly enjoy more than you admit?**  
Not sure it’s a secret but laundry! I love having my dresser and closet fully stocked at the end of the week. I feel more prepared for anything that might happen that week. Even if I have to do something last minute I can do it in my favorite jeans or whatever. It’s that small sense of control and a full reset for the new week.
