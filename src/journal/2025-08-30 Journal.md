## Journal
I spent the whole day cleaning one little corner of my bedroom. It somehow got a bit of mold. I think I pushed my nightstand too close to a wall that gets cold in Spring and Winter, so the air stopped circulating. So yeah. Scrubbed it all off. Then let it soak with vinegar for an hour. Tomorrow I’ll do a final layer of Borax because it’s supposed to inhibit growth. But I also got a fan and a DampRid to keep that corner dry forever. It sucks that it grew at all. I’ve never had that happen before. But it was just my furniture choice and me not knowing to check that created this problem so it shouldn’t happen again. I might even repaint with that special Kilz paint so it’s even more secure. But I need to move my bed which just… isn’t moveable. So IDK how to solve that problem yet.  

So yeah, a rough day but I figured since it’s a long weekend for me it would be a good time to get it done. I cut some sticker sheets to add to my inventory too. So I can only hope tomorrow is a little more balanced with… fun or rest. Oh and how could I forget! We got our first local sweet corn of the season. Some of it was affected by our recent flooding so some kernels were burst open, but it was so yummy. 1st one is the best!
