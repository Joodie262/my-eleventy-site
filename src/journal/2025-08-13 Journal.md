## Journal
I'm changing my daily habit from social media post to self-care. I'm pretty burnt out on social media so it's just not going to be a daily priority for me anymore. I'd rather work directly on my business designing new products. Those will last and add value for a lot longer than anything I put on social media anyway.  

Last night it took me hours to fall asleep. My dental cleaning got cancelled so I think I had saved up energy for that. Then it had nowhere to go. So‚Äîinsomnia. Not all that surprising, but frustrating anyway. Maybe I'll cut a few sticker sheets to feel productive today, or work on my special app thing for Hobonichi planners. Not sure yet, but coding does seem to have my heart lately.

## Prompt
**Prompt 13: What's your current "comfort rewatch" TV show, movie, or YT channel?**  
Right now I'm watching "The Vampire Diaries" but I don't know how far I'll get. It's not an ultimate favorite, but it reminds me of nostalgic fashion and high school drama. I watch old TCMC videos from Helen if I want something cozy and very chill. A classic rewatch is "Supernatural" for me. I've watched it many times!
