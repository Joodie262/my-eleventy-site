## Word
**meander** *(verb)*  
- to follow a winding or intricate course; that is, one with a lot of turns and curves—or to walk slowly without a specific goal, purpose, or direction  
> We spent the afternoon meandering around the seaside town.  
> The river meanders through the canyon.  

## Journal
Spent the day working on stuff for the shop. Got to work right away restocking low products. Then I was thinking about my next product and remembered I need to make 2026 calendar stickers for the Hobonichi planners. Took me awhile to remember how I did it last year so I documented the process this time in my Obsidian notes. Should be pretty quick from here on out. I’m just proofing them now and I should be able to get them listed this weekend. Yay! I still need to keep restocking lots of staple items and stuff some more envelopes for Q3 when I get a chance.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 15: What’s your most-used emoji, and does it fit your actual personality?**  
Mine is the blushing, smiling emoji surrounded by 3 little hearts. I think it fits me well because I do feel that way a lot. It’s like the “awww” emoji to me. I find a lot of things cute or adorable or I’m thankful in that way. I’m glad it wasn’t an LOL emoji cuz I rarely laugh that hard like that.
