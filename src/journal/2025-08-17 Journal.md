## Journal
Yesterday was surprisingly productive. I’m going to take it easy today. I really had 3 really focused days in a row. Which is very unusual for me. Maybe I’m getting excited because Hobonichi reveals their 2026 planners every day on social media. So I’m thinking about the future! I’ve been thinking about the end of year, fall, and the holidays too. Lots of projects and ideas percolating.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 17: What’s the most recent piece of advice you’ve completely ignored?**  
Kind of hard to think of any. If I feel like certain advice isn’t right for me, I think I just mentally trash it after I hear it. Otherwise I just feel guilty. I guess I heard that if you have pale skin you should really be getting your skin checked regularly with a dermatologist. I’m still planning to make an appointment but I just don’t know logistically how to make the appointment and make sure it’s covered by insurance. So I’m procrastinated because ADHD makes it feel like too many steps. So it’s advice I will eventually get to but for now it’s getting ignored.
