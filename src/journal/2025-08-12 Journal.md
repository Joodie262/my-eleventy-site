## Journal
Ugh I have to be an adult today and take care of my body for future me. Present day me is annoyed. I know lots of people don’t like the dentist and try to be mature about it. It will just never not be weird to have someone all up in my personal space bubble like that. I just find it awkward and that’s that. My sensory system hates it. Unfortunately it will probably drain all my good creative energy for the day so I’m not planning on any big projects for the day.

**Cancelled** — Well the dentist called and had to cancel because they don’t have any power. The flooding backed up more in town, and we had a windy storm last night. I guess more places lost power. What a mess.

## Prompt
**Prompt 12:** If you could swap lives with a fictional character for one day, who would it be?  
Maybe a Dr. Strange type person. If I could teleport and see a bunch of world landmarks in a day that would be so cool. And the power to control reality, yeah. I don’t love travel or sleeping in hotels so just a quick trip around the world for zero money. Seems like the best way to maximize one day of a borrowed life.
