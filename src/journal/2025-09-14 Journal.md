## Journal
Taking care of all the routine weekly chores today. I decided to take yesterday off from work.  

Played a game on my Switch called *Escape from Mystwood Mansion*. I finished it—but forgot one thing so it was totally unsatisfying. Whoops! Also all the puzzles felt inconsistent—did 75% of them were fine but the others were too hard or just super complicated. It just felt like not the most professionally made game. Could have used more testing I think. 3.5 of 5 stars.  

It was a nice change of pace from all the work though. Hopefully my brain appreciated the break!  

## Prompt
**Prompt 14: What's something cozy you wish was socially acceptable year-round?**  
It’s not unacceptable but hoodies and hot chocolate. Those things just don’t mesh well with summer heat. But both are cozy vibes! It might be less special and cozy if it was done all year round though. I do kind of wish I was one of those people who’s cold all the time so I could wear hoodies and sweaters all year long—but I’m the opposite.
