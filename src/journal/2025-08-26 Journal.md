## Word

## Journal
I watched a random YouTube video last night from Wired (I think) where they asked a teacher a bunch of questions. She had the best energy and attitude ever. I actually teared up because she seemed so awesome and caring. But then I couldn’t fall asleep because it brought up so many emotions.  

The public school system failed me. It’s always hard for me to think about high school particularly. So my mind just couldn’t quiet down for sleep. My heart aches for any child who doesn’t fit perfectly into that system (or just can’t find a way to make it work).  

I wish all teachers could be empathetic and flexible with all the unique types of students. She said something I loved: “Every student is in their own right place at the right time.” Like if someone learns “faster” or “slower,” it’s all okay—that’s just their pace. How silly is it that just because you’re at a certain age you’re all supposed to know the exact same stuff.  

Life happens. I wish teachers had more resources and more influence over customizing their teaching for all the types of kids they teach. It just brought up so many emotions. I wish I could have thrived more in school. I wish every child had an amazing teacher who was kind and compassionate to them. I wish emotional skills and kindness were part of every education.  

I wish. I wish. Kids deserve better than a one-size-fits-all approach.
