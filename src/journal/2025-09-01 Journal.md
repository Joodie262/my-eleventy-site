## Journal
Got all my monthly accounting and tracking done for August first thing today. I basically took the whole month off from social media, so that part was quick. I even restocked some low items and filled orders for tomorrow. It was a deeply productive long weekend, but it also made me pretty tired.  

I can’t believe I totally forgot about the 2026 Hobonichi release time for over an hour yesterday. I did watch the Yoseka Countdown party livestream on YouTube once I made my purchases. Haha, just participating on my own weird timeline.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 1: What’s your favorite thing to wear when the seasons change?**  
I love boots when it’s colder. But the hoodie is a classic. Nothing cozier than a hoodie. I have a lot of favorites and miss them in the summer. Plus that big pocket in front is just plain practical. Not a ton of women’s clothes with pockets that large. Plus they just feel heavy and that’s just so relaxing.  

Fall is the best season for fashion. Love a plaid button down or a light jacket, or a fuzzy fleece. Oh there’s so many options! I can’t wait for it to cool down outside now.
