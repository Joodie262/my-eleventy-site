## Journal
Free day – what should I do?  

Hello Friday! I’m torn between a long walk at the beach or a big design day for the shop. Good weather is so hard to come by but an entirely free day to dig in deep to design is  too! I’m leaning toward shop work day because I want to get seasonal stuff in the shop ASAP. I could always go out tomorrow or Sunday. Then it would be like a reward for getting some work done! I’ll start with some Thanksgiving art and see how much I can get done with that. Then maybe Christmas? I can only dream of getting that far. We’ll see.  

Later… I got a sticker sheet designed for Thanksgiving. Just have the listings and photos to do before those can go live. Very happy that’s done! My Cookie character is celebrating all the holidays lately. Haha! Maybe Christmas is next.  

I ran out of my facial moisturizer today so went to re-order and they raised the price by over $20! It was already a semi-luxurious purchase before but now I can’t justify the cost. That’s just INSANE. I’ve been using it for years and my skin loves it. I have to fall down another skincare rabbit hole to find a replacement with all the right ingredients. Ugh.
