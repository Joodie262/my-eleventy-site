*Not sure if I’ve ever heard this word!* Well it feels like I have but I didn't really get the meaning. 

## Journal
I’m going to try to have the most mosquito-bite-free outdoor experience possible today during PEAK mosquito season. I’m going to try to keep long sleeves/pants, I’ll use my Picaridin lotion, and I’m going to a sandy beach which hopefully means wind. Maximal comfort strategy engaged. I’ll probably focus more on the walk aspect than any rock hunting if the bugs are noticeably bad. At least a little outdoor time is better than none. I’ll report back on the excursion later!  

Report: Not one. Single. Bug. Yay! IDK if it was the clothing or bug spray or the wind but it was my most perfect outdoor day. The waves were up really high so all the rocks were underwater (well, the good ones at least!) but I didn’t mind. I did get a tiny blister on my pinkie toe because I wore my sandals when they were wet. But in my defense that was because last time I walked barefoot I got bruises on the bottom of my feet so I was trying to prevent that. It’s dangerous out there!
