## Word
**enmity** *(noun)*  
- a formal word that refers to a very deep unfriendly feeling, such as hatred or ill will, that is often felt mutually.  
> Having to collaborate on the project only increased the bitterness and enmity between the two coworkers, who had never gotten along.

## Journal
Not sure why but my stomach woke me up at 5:30am and I did not feel well at all. Yuck! I eventually got back to sleep but it was not a fun night. I feel fine now! We ate a nice HelloFresh dinner with pork and spaghetti. IDK if maybe that was it? I never really know.  

I spent all day yesterday working on coloring my new Cousin sticker kit. I'm always spinning my wheels with color. I don't like for it to look too simple or garish but I also don't know when to stop either. I do my best! I need to make the little art deco for the boxes and then the art is mostly done.  

Later... spent the day finalizing my new kit and did a test print-and-cut (it looks good!). I am mentally exhausted at the idea of writing a listing though, so maybe I should take it easy. The burnout is feeling super tangible right now. I really don't know how anyone runs a sticker shop successfully, all on their own. I am wiped out. Phew!  

## Prompt
**Prompt 20: What trend have you seen lately that you're tempted to try?**  
I'm pretty out of the loop on trends. I mostly consume "planner" content on social media. I have been wanting to use my Traveler's Notebook more even though I do zero traveling. Just as another journal. That's not really a trend though. I'm just super focused on shop work right now.
