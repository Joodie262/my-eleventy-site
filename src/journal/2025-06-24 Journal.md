## Prompt
**If you could invent a summer ritual or tradition just for you, what would it be?**  
A week of isolation. IDK I feel weird pressure in summer to always be going places and doing things. But I actually don’t love doing that in summer. (More of a fall travel girl.) But I just want a guilt-free week of NOT DOING, permission to just rot away the days. Isn’t that what summer was for as a kid anyway? Boredom. Trying to invent new ways to entertain yourself. No big stress or responsibilities. I want that “school’s out” vibe again. Just the concept that summer will never end. Oh the nostalgia! To be a kid again. I think my brain is in a restore mode anyway right now. It just feels right to relax and enjoy time passing with fun lil projects. Maybe the heat advisory over the past few days cooked my brain a little and now I need to do a major rejuvenation.
