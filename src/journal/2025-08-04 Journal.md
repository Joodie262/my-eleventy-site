## Journal
Back to normal life today. Not getting too many boxes at work though so no major stress. Just the normal stress. My stomach was giving me some trouble last night. Not really sure why. I guess the pasta primavera was too creamy? Annoying. We are down to 2 episodes of *The Sandman* on Netflix. Not sure what else is left. This last episode felt like a finale.  

Oh I got tags to work on my 11ty site. That’s fun. It’s all a bit harder than I want it to be but then it wouldn’t feel quite as good when I finally figure something out. IDK what my final goal is with the project but it’s pretty fun (usually) to just play around with the layout and design for now. Plus it's a way to go back to any day in my planner even if I don’t have it sitting in front of me.

## Prompt
**What’s a small hill you’re absolutely willing to die on?**  
Baths are better than showers. They take longer BUT shouldn’t resetting your body for a new day be a little more indulgent? Enjoyable? Peaceful? Relaxing? I can’t even hear my music in a shower. Plus I just don’t feel as deeply clean. Showers work in a pinch or a rush. But the full bath is where the real body reset happens.
