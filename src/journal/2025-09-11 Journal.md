## Journal
Hello Thursday! It was nice to take a little break from shop work yesterday. I do need to remember to balance rejuvenation with hard work—even during busy seasons. It’s such a weird concept to feel pulled to do work but to not always follow through. Because in the end that’s the most sustainable path. I suppose with normal jobs where you work with and for other people you don’t get any choice. If they want to try to overwork you, they can. But there is also a “shared workload” to help offset some overwhelm.  

It’s just an interesting gig being your own boss. And being a team of one person. I’m sure there isn’t one “right” way to do it. But I should enforce more balance when I can. Particularly with a creative/art business.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 11: What snack is wildly seasonal for you and why?**  
Very specifically a 3 Musketeers candy bar. It’s only for Halloween and literally no other time of the year. Maybe hot chocolate for winter, pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. I think they’re just so seasonal because that’s when I first and subsequently had them the most. It’s not that they belong to specific times, it’s just too weird otherwise.
