## Journal
A new week and tomorrow starts quarter 3! Goodbye to the first half of the year. I have 4 orders to mail today. The sale is going okay. I slept okay. Lost my Apple Pencil somehow though. That thing is so hard to find. I never set it up in the "Find My" app either. I didn't know I needed to do that. It'll turn up eventually. Hopefully I don't sit on it and break it.

Just a normal day at work today. Two pallets of stuff to unload. Zero space for it but oh well. At least it's not a crazy holiday or anything. I do wish we had a nicer weather day this week but it looks too hot all week. I want to go for a hike. Or to go to the beach. Stinking summer weather.

## Prompt
**Prompt 30: What‚Äôs something you‚Äôre weirdly excited to start in the second half of the year?**  
Uhm... I don't know of any major projects I have planned. More of the same for the shop. Just keep making new products. I should probably plan something that makes me more excited. Maybe my next zine project. I have lots of ideas. And I get to stretch different creative muscles than usual. I like the variety‚Äîmore writing sometimes than just pure visual art. They take longer to polish and finish but it's a fun workflow.
