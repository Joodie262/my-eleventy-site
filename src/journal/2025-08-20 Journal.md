## Journal
I bought myself some new work shoes. I realized mine are super old (2019) and maybe not very supportive at all anymore. Maybe the new pair will help me feel slightly less exhausted after work. I hope so anyway. I was surprisingly tired last night and I fell asleep a whole hour earlier than usual. Not exactly sure why... maybe that potential burnout I‚Äôm trying to avoid. I must need more than usual these days.  

I‚Äôve got some shop stuff to finalize today: inventory for the 2026 calendars and the Etsy and TikTok listings. If I feel super energetic I‚Äôd like to keep drawing my Halloween sheet too. I really should do a social media post too but that‚Äôs probably beyond my capacity today. Maybe I could just do part of it?  

Later: I got some decent work done but also sprinkled in my fun HTML website coding so I wouldn‚Äôt get too tired of cutting stickers. The calendars are live. I also picked up an Rx I need for tomorrow. It was a good day. Tomorrow I‚Äôll probably be mentally fatigued, so again no huge projects planned. Gotta do as much self care as I can. It might not be too humid so I could actually get to go for a walk for once this month? What a dream. We‚Äôll see what happens.
