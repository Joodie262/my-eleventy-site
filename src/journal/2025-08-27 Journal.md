## Word
**nebulous** *(adj.)*  
- A formal word used to describe something that is difficult to see, understand, or describe; in other words, something indistinct or vague.  
> A lot of philosophical concepts can seem nebulous at first, but a good instructor can cut through the jargon and help students see how they apply to day-to-day life.

## Journal
I'm having a hard time trying to decide what Hobonichi planners to get for 2026. I know I need the A5 Avec—that’s my daily darling. But if I design stickers for the other sizes I want something to test them in. I like to see something tangible before I release it. I do have empty pages from my 2025 A6 and Weeks but I feel weird combining tests with real planning for some reason? IDK. It’s just expensive too. I’m trying to save up for a laptop this year and I just don’t know how to decide. I used my A6 + Weeks very sporadically/randomly. The A6 was more mental health/personal but I find it hard to write in at that size. I don’t do small well. I try not to feel guilty for empty pages but with money being a lot tighter I’m trying to be careful.

Later: Today was kind of frustrating really. My main cut machine malfunctioned and I spent over an hour troubleshooting. And my 2nd machine did fail later in the evening too. On a day I was finding work a bit overwhelming before any of that happened. Just nothing to say other than: annoyed. At least I got all of the September journaling prompts done and posted everywhere. Just a mixed bag of a day. Tried my best.
