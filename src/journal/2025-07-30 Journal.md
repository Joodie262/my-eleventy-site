## Journal
Taking today to just work on fun stuff and relax. I played with some web coding and I’ll work on my crochet more later. The yarn keeps rubbing my finger and irritating it though. They make “thimble tape” to protect fingers. It sticks to itself so it’s not as messy as a band-aid. So glad to know I’m not the only one who was bothered by such a thing.  

I thought I was being “overly sensitive” maybe. But I need to stop thinking that. It’s not helpful. If I’m uncomfortable then that’s just the truth. No use trying to deny my reality anymore. I’ve got to trust my feelings and instincts a little more. Not gaslight myself.

## Prompt
**Prompt 30: How do you like to get ready for a new month—any little rituals or habits?**  
Just by filling out my monthly spread in my planner. I can see all the appointments and obligations at a glance and get a sense of the kind of month ahead. It’s also just a good time to start wrapping up the current month in my mind. Check to see what I all accomplished. I write down every little success and win so I don’t forget. I struggle to think of time accurately and I often forget what really happened in a month so it’s really helpful to review.
