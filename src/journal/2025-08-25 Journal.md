## Word
**Undulant** *(adjective)*  
- Describes things that rise and fall in waves, or things that have a wavy form, outline, or surface.  
> *The exhibit featured a painting with beautiful green strokes that resembled undulant hills.*  

*(I knew the word "undulating," so I could guess this one, but I don’t think I’ve heard "undulant" being used that much.)*

## Journal
Another perfect weather day today. But it’s a workday, so I’ll be stuck inside for most of it. Oh well! This whole week is going to be cooler than average, so I’ll just embrace it when I can. I can’t believe August is already ending this week. I’ll have all my normal accounting/spreadsheets to fill out. I also need to finish the September journaling prompts. I really liked August’s. They were fun but also made you think. It was a good vibe.  

Tomorrow morning our furnace is getting its annual servicing. Hopefully the temp stays cool so running the furnace doesn’t warm me up. Hah!  

## Prompt
**Prompt 25: What’s the most “you” thing you’ve done this month?**  
Easy. I started a large crochet project. Made a lot of fast initial progress… and then when the task felt slightly overwhelming and slow, I halted completely. The dopamine just wasn’t hitting. Sooo… my poor Mushroom Guy plushie has a head and 2/3 of a body but now has just been abandoned for an unknown amount of time. CLASSIC ME!  

I have my place marked and all the instructions are marked too. So at any point I can pick it up again. It’s just the most “me” thing ever. I’m a super strong starter of projects. Finishing is not my specialty, however. At least I try new things and get joy from the parts I do!
