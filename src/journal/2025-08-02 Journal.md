## Word
**palimpsest** *(noun)*  
- **original use**: refers to writing material used one or more times after earlier writing has been erased; the underlying text is "in palimpsest"  
- **extended use**: refers to something that has usually diverse layers or aspects apparent beneath the surface  
> Scholars believe the motive for making palimpsests was often economic — reusing parchment was cheaper than preparing a new skin.

## Journal
The Hobonichi theme for 2026 is “You Love You”! ☺️ Well, do you? I can’t wait to see what covers and visual themes they have. Even though I’ll probably just keep my same A5 Avec that I did this year. And I splurged on my cover by POTR so it would be wise to use it again unless they release the best design ever.

My lungs are tired from the low air quality yesterday. My Fitbit says my SpO2 overnight was 91% even though I didn’t do anything strenuous. I feel okay though. My mind is a lot clearer. I’ve already cut half of the holiday stickers and done the accounting.

I’ll only do a little more shop work then try to wrap it up. Maybe do some social media stuff.

## Prompt
**Prompt 2: If you had to give your current mood a weather report, what would it be?**  
Maybe partly cloudy, comfortable temps with an early sunset. Haha! Does that make sense? I’m a tiny bit tired thus a few clouds. But otherwise comfortable — no big stressors currently. And since it’s the weekend I’ll wrap things up early with “sunset.” Overall pretty good!
