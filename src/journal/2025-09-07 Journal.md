## Journal
Hello Sunday! Whoa I got a lot of new orders last night. I guess the algorithms like it when you add new products to the shop. I have 6 already and the day is young. I’ve seen some people already have their 2026 Hobonichi planners on social media. My order from Atlas Stationers still hasn’t been fulfilled but I know that their shipment arrived so they’re working on it.

Later… I spent the day filling orders and restocking sticker inventory. I maybe pushed it today with work because I tried to cut more after dinner but I screwed up the first few sheets. It’s frustrating how different my brain works in the evening. I wish I could get more done. I’m getting concerned about my ability to keep up this year. I don’t know if I’ll be able to or not.

## Prompt
**Prompt 7: What weird or oddly specific smell makes you feel nostalgic?**  
Crayons or Elmer’s Glue. Instant childhood memories. That crayon wax smell is literally only crayons. Candle wax isn’t the same. A fresh box of crayons is just a highly specific thing for me. And yes I pronounce it like “cran”—sue me.
