## Journal
Got my hair trimmed today! It needed it. Also got a coupon for $10 off next time. I need to remember to use that! It was pouring rain right before I left the house but when I got out there, there wasn’t even a drop. Had to keep switching my windshield wipers all the way to the salon. Wacky! Oh and the Halloween store is open already! Too soon! I’m okay with autumn stuff but Halloween is still almost two months away!

Later: I don’t really know why but my creative brain was not functioning today. I had a big burst towards the end of August with lots of highly focused energy days, so this must be the brain’s way of rebalancing things out. Just a day to watch the second part of "Wednesday" on Netflix and put together a jigsaw puzzle I started yesterday. Back to work tomorrow.

## Prompt
**Prompt 3: What’s the most ridiculous fall-themed product you secretly love?**  
I don’t know that I fall for any seasonal hype products… I don’t love coffee so I don’t get the pumpkin spice latte. I’m not really a seasonal food person either. I guess I kind of wanted apple cider but that’s not ridiculous or secret. I’m just not secretive with anything.
