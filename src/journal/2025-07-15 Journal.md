## Journal
Totally random and drifty energy today. I've had a lot of foggy days lately. I keep getting the feeling I'm between 2 life stages or something. Like I'm soon going to have clarity‚Äîbut for now things are just confusing and messy. I'll have a good day and then at least 3 weird energy days. The ratio is off. I'm just trying to be patient and wait for things to normalize. Maybe I have some random summer blues. It's hot and humid every day. It sucks.

Today was okay. I got more crochet work done on my mushroom. The yarn hurts my fingers a bit though. I'm trying to do a tight stitch so the amigurumi looks good. But it's hard on the hands. The stuffing should arrive tomorrow so I can get going on the head shape. Not sure if the eyes I got will be big enough but I'll make them work. Nothing about this project has gone according to plan so far. I bought all the wrong stuff. I might be able to manage anyway. Just shifting the mental image I have for the final product.

That's all I have energy for today. I'm gonna go watch some anime and rest my tired brain.
