## Journal
Phew no major rainfall last night. Just a short storm. Hopefully it didn’t make the flooding much worse. My aunt went to the Falls and apparently it stinks so bad they didn’t stop to look. How sad! And I’ve seen countless people wading into it with their kids to play. Oh the bacteria of it all. Do they not watch the news or what? M. says the lake has receded a bit overnight so that’s good. We got sooo lucky. I’m so grateful. I may have lost a little sleep but not having to gut our basement or be trapped in our neighborhood is a wonderful blessing. Hopefully none of the roads I take to work got flooded!

## Prompt
**Prompt 11: What's your most irrational fear that you know is silly, but still have?**  
No origin story but I’m terrified of walking behind people fishing. I have a fear that they’ll swing back their pole to get the line out and it will instead catch on my face and hook me. It’s such a specific thing… maybe I had a nightmare like that or something. I just do NOT want to walk near anyone that’s fishing at all.

Much later: Let’s all just agree that Bachelor in Paradise is a ridiculous show. I don’t know why hate-watching something feels so cathartic though?
