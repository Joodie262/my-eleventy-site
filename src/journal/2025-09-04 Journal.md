## Word
**abeyance** *(noun)*  
- A formal word that is almost always used in the phrase "in abeyance" to describe something in a temporary state of inactivity; that is, something in a state of suspension.  
> The legal case is now being held in abeyance while the parties attempt to find a mutually acceptable solution.  

*Note: If I have heard this word before I didn’t know what it meant. Love a totally new to me word of the day.*

## Journal
It’s a bit weird to be going back to my day job again so soon. But Labor Day makes my week weird. It doesn’t give me a day off—just pushes my work day later. Oh well. At least I was able to do all my monthly work on the 1st of the month and be done with it.  

It’s going to be so nice and cool out today. I’m loving these extended fall weather previews so much. We had rain yesterday and I wasn’t even mad—just happy the worst of summer is over.  

Yesterday I hoped to do some design work but I just felt braindead. No extra juice in the tank. I was disappointed but I try to listen to my body when it tells me to rest, so I just relaxed. Hopefully this weekend will be a good one for new designs!  

## Prompt
**Prompt 4: What’s a recent impulse you gave into with zero regrets?**  
Quite literally I got the random craving for an Oreo today. So I bought some after work and had a few after dinner. No regrets. I rarely eat Oreos anyway, so it was one of those odd things that you might as well just have fun with anyway. At least I for reasonable, non-dangerous/overly indulgent items!
