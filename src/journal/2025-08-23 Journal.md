## Journal
Hello to the weekend. I feel torn on Saturdays between doing shop work and doing a more traditional off-work weekend. I could go either way. I have some momentum going from yesterday. I don’t often finalize art, go through all the steps and list a product all in one day. I did reorganize my inventory storage yesterday so now I have room for more sticker sheets. I have a lot of my basic functional sheets that continue to sell well. But I’m having more fun with decorative and Cookie character stickers. I feel like you need a lot to choose from to really enjoy a new character in your planner, so I’m just slowly building up Cookie’s Collection. I hope I’m right about that. My recent Cousin kit sells well too. Those take weeks to finalize the art for though, so it’s harder to start new ones.  

Later… I changed my sticker sheet pricing finally. I did some research into “competitors” and I realized I was under-pricing my work. I kept prices lower on my Shopify because there are less fees on each order. I hope everyone is okay with it. I just haven’t yet made enough to cover material costs, so hopefully this will help bridge that gap. Also updated my shop theme to the latest version. Yay!
