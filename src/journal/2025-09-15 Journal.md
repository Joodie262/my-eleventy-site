## Journal
It’s a new week. I took Saturday and Sunday off from shop stuff. I’m feeling more fresh mentally but I am a little worried I broke my momentum. I only have one order to mail today. Maybe it’s unrelated but who knows! I need to pick up some groceries after work today. It should be a normal day, nothing exciting in the forecast.  

Although my order from Boston General Store might arrive. It said last Friday but it got delayed so now it says today. There’s no rush but it would be nice to “complete” my 2026 Hobonichi haul.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 15: What seasonal trend are you irrationally excited (or annoyed) about?**  
Maybe this makes me a cranky old person but I’m not into trick or treating. I don’t want to hand out candy to a bunch of strangers who come to my house. I enjoyed doing it as a kid — trick or treating — but the adult portion is not fun for me. It’s probably because I’m a bit of a hermit, and my home is my sanctuary away from the world of people. It’s just not my thing. M. always hands out the candy anyway. I’ll just put out the candy bowl if I ever have to one day. Sorry kids, I’d rather be you!
