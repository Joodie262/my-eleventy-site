## Journal
M comes back from visiting J today. Yay! Back to normal. I ended up finishing my Annual Holidays sticker sheets yesterday. I even got them listed. But by dinner my brain was melted and I struggled a lot to make myself food. So a productive day followed by a crash. I guess that makes sense even if I find it very annoying.  
Today is just a personal prep day. Not gonna do any shop work. I’m listening to my body and it was shouting for rest.

M. came back! All's right with the world. I missed her a lot this time. My whole routine felt a bit off and weird. I couldn't figure out quite how to spend my evenings. I watched some totally random movies I don’t even remember now. She's like my anchor. Even when my ADHD wants me to go wild I stick to more of a schedule when she's around. It's just easier to relax and unwind too. I had a really hard time falling asleep both nights she was gone. All is well for now though. Phew! I could use a little more shut eye tonight- back to work tomorrow.

## Prompt
**Prompt 3: What’s the weirdest snack combo you genuinely enjoy?**  
I’m not sure I eat any weird combos. I like my food simple. I’m not an adventurous food person. Usually if someone finds a choice I make weird, it’s because it’s very bland. Like no ketchup or anything on fries or a hot dog. IDK, I’m not big on condiments.
