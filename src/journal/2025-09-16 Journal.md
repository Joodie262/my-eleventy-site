## Journal
Wow I should NOT have had that hot dog for dinner last night. Tummy troubles for real! Ugh. Was also just wiped after work yesterday so it was a double whammy. Hopefully today isn’t nearly so exhausting. But also why is it the middle of summer heat again? I’ve seen leaves changing on trees—this can’t happen. I do NOT approve. Our fall preview was so beautiful and lovely.  

Anyways—I have nothing but trouble with my TikTok Shop. Everything had been fine for a few months but now my local post office is back to not scanning my outgoing packages so the system thinks I’m not sending things out when I 100% am. I’ll have to walk in and get a receipt for every package again. Super annoying and time consuming. You never know how slow the line will be. Why don’t they just scan all mail from the mailboxes? I do not get it at all.

## Prompt
**Prompt 16: What’s your personal definition of “productive” right now?**  
Probably not a very balanced idea of it right now. I feel like I want to be designing new sticker sheets everyday and keeping up with production and orders and social media all at the same time. Conceptually I understand that it’s productive to rest and rejuvenate but I don’t always allow that reality. It should be just that I try each day and do what I can.
