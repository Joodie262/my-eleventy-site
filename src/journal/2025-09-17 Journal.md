## Journal
Not sure if this ink is dark enough to be considered easily legible but I filled my new pen with it, so we’re stuck for awhile. My final order from Boston General Store arrived yesterday and I got myself a treat: a TWSBI Eco with a fine nib in Espresso Bronze. It’s very pretty! And now I’m all set with my planners for 2026.  

Today they are sealing cracks in the pavement so I had to move my van to a different street. I used to have divots in the pavement where I always parked but they filled those in yesterday.  

I think I’ll do some design work for the shop today since I’m basically stuck at home. I think I should make another weekly kit. It would be nice to have more than 2 in the shop. But they take awhile so IDK how far I’ll get today.

## Prompt
**If you had a shop mascot, what would it be and what would they do all day?**  
Well I guess this question only makes sense for shop owners. Maybe a chicken? Running around all day, feeling scattered and overwhelmed, haha. At least lately. I feel pulled in a million directions but I’m spending my time wisely... but also, I do have Cookie, my actual shop mascot. A chocolate chip cookie with a bite taken out. Sweet but has been through some stuff. Also a good analogy for myself at times!
