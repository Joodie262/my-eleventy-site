## Journal
Hello Tuesday! I used my new face moisturizer last night and my skin is not happy. My face feels hurt today. I patch tested on my hand and no reaction. It might go away as my face gets used to it but I’m just grumpy they raised the price on my fave moisturizer sooo much. Us sensitive skin girlies can’t take the changes! I miss my old face wash by Eucerin too. I try my best to find similar ingredients but it’s hopeless. There’s just too many products to choose from! Maybe I should have looked for the cheap one from Trader Joe’s before buying the $25 stuff on Amazon. I don’t have the patience to do a Sephora sample run. Also it’s all pretty pricey there. This could all also be because of the changing humidity too… ugh.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 9: What’s something you hoard even though you barely use it?**  
Oof! Probably a few things. Computers probably. They cost so much when you buy them that it’s hard to let them go. Plus they have whole chunks of my life on them. And I love a random tech hobby every couple of years. Maybe shoes too. I love having the right pair for the exact weather/outfit. I’m always trying to balance my own comfort with style. Same with some of my clothes too. Probably because I’m very sensory sensitive.
