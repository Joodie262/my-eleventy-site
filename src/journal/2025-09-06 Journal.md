## Journal
Hello Saturday! I have four orders to mail today. People are starting to buy their 2026 calendars so I think sticker season is beginning.  

I refilled my printer ink for stickers yesterday, which is the first time I’ve had to do that since I got it. Good to know the ink lasts a long time. I want to write and photograph yesterday’s Thanksgiving sticker sheet so that’s totally done. I also need to re-ink this pen…  (Running out of ink!)

Christmas, Thanksgiving, and Halloween are all live now in the shop! Cookie’s collection is starting to feel a lot more complete. I’m so proud of myself for keeping up with an idea I believe in. My little Cookie character has had a bite taken out of them but they keep their spirits high!  

I kind of want to make another zine now for Cookie to be featured in, but that’s not high on the seasonal importance list. Tomorrow will be either an off day for me or just restocking. Two sheets in two days from sketch to live is a LOT on my brain. Really, really happy to have some seasonal offerings this year though. Tired brain and all. Haha!
