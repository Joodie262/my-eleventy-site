## Journal
Happy September Equinox!  
Fall starts today but our weather hasn’t gotten the memo. I have 6 orders to fill today—woot woot. I got bit by a fall fashion shopping bug last night. It always happens around my birthday because it’s the only season I really enjoy shopping for clothes. Sweaters and jackets! Boots and bags! Summer is the worst—I always feel too exposed and when it’s humid I just want to wear whatever absorbs sweat the best LOL.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 22: What’s a recent comment or message that made you smile?**  
I was at work last week lugging buckets of water around—being grumpy about it. And someone saw me and said “I like your hair!” It snapped me totally out of it and made me smile. It felt really genuine. Ever since I switched to my natural waves a year or two ago, no one really comments anymore (which makes sense because it doesn’t change). But it was nice to hear from a stranger and broke my stormy mood for the moment.  

I wish I was better about complimenting other people. I get scared I’ll get stuck in a whole awkward conversation if I open the door so I always chicken out unless I know someone really well already. Introverting is hard like that. I never know when to push myself out of my comfort zone. Will I regret it, or will it be a kind/awesome thing?
