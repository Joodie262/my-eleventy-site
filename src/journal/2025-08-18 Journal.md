## Journal
I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn’t get back to sleep for an hour. Those types of nights totally ruin my mood. I hate wondering: will I get back to sleep or will I just lay here doing nothing until morning comes? It’s probably largely because I ate a brownie after dinner. Too indulgent and my stomach said no. But when life offers you a brownie you gotta take it! lol.  

Anyways I did take it easy yesterday but ended up with a headache anyway. I drew 3 stickers and then I told myself to stop so I could rest. I guess that was too much. Me and my body lately… can’t just get along I guess.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 18: What’s your go-to response when someone asks, “How’s it going?”**  
Easy? “I’m good! How are you?” Sometimes I’ll throw in something about the weather: “Sure is hot out there.” As a neurodivergent human, it’s pretty normal to script answers like this. I try to change it slightly if I know someone a little better. But often people aren’t actually curious about your life and they are just being polite — a quick answer is sufficient and even preferred to a totally honest one.
