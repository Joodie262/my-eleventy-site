## Journal
I wanted/needed to get a lot of work for the business done yesterday but I just got technical issues instead. I’m still annoyed about it. But some important stuff did get finished so it wasn’t a total loss.  

I sold my first Halloween Cookie sheet and my Colored Holidays sheet. That always feels great. It’s like a proof of concept that yes, that work you did was indeed worth it to at least one person.  

I have the weirdest pain on my tongue. I noticed it yesterday but it kept getting worse into the evening. I don’t know if it’s from the dentist last week or if I bit it in my sleep somehow? It’s making it kind of hard to chew and talk. Usually mouth stuff heals super fast though so I hope it just goes away on its own. I don’t think there’s much medicine that’s useful here.

## Prompt
**Prompt 28: Which everyday object would you enchant to have magical powers?**  
Car → teleports.  
Bed → has a sleep on switch, for instantly falling asleep.  
Bathtub → automatically cleans me and washes my hair and all that.  
Closet → adjusts all clothing to a perfect fit for me.  
I can't pick just one!
