## Journal
I have off work this Thursday due to my dentist appointment getting rescheduled so yesterday was my only day this week. Woo! I think I'll work on a Halloween sticker sheet and get that finished this week. I got my biggest order of sticker paper yesterday. I believe this shop is going to pick up steam, so I’m increasing how much I keep in stock. Should make the busy season a little easier on me. I hope. I need to finish listing the 2026 calendars too, stalled out at the photography phase.  

**Later** — Okay, I took some photos and listed them on my website… only to realize I didn’t actually cut any inventory for 2 of 3 sizes. Wow brain! Whoops. So I cut some and I’ll finish the rest tomorrow. I swear I’m running on brain fumes lately. I kind of wish I could take a month off for a sort of resting vacation. I’ll do okay for a day or two, and then my energy just completely tanks out. I hope I don’t go full burnout mode. I’m trying to pace myself but doing it all alone just means stuff HAS to get done whether I have energy for it or not. Running a whole business requires a constant shifting of roles and usually that’s what makes it fun for me. But when I’m tired it just means all areas can suffer equally.
