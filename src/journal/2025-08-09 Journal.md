## Journal
Backfill: I spent the whole day on a new project. I finally figured out an easy workflow. I put the code on GitHub as a repository and then open the code space to edit the code. From there I use a Live Server extension to test all my changes — quick and easy in another browser window. I can even use my iPad, which is mainly what I use daily anywhere. I made lots of progress and figured out how to commit changes to Git as I went. I’m creating a super fun tool for anyone who wants to track their weather in a planner or journal.

I’m doing most of the code in JavaScript, which I’m honestly not super familiar with, but this project isn’t super complex — it’s layout heavy. So it’s fun to learn as I go. The more I change, the more I understand it. I’m thinking I can make a few of the styles available free, then maybe add a one-time paid upgrade to unlock more themes and options. IDK — I’ve never sold a code project like this before. I’ve made tools for myself, but if it breaks I can either abandon it or try to fix it. IDK if I’d be all that helpful in a “tech support” scenario. I’ll just wait and see how I feel once it’s finished.
