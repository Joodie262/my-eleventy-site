## Journal
Finally a free day with super nice weather! Ah! Yay! It had been too long. I went to my favorite beach for guaranteed fun and rocks to look at. The waves were big-ish but the absolute perfect temperature. The breeze was perfect. I didn’t notice the air quality feeling smokey either. You could see it if you looked far enough away though. Lots of people there and a few other rock hunters. Nothing spectacular found but I did get a piece of sea glass… my 2nd or 3rd piece ever. Just clear in color but still exciting to me anyway. I feel so relieved I finally got some sun and air.

Oh! I saw 4 sandhill cranes today and a deer. The other day after work I saw a mom and baby deer cross the road. So cute!  

## Prompt
**Prompt 1: What’s the last app you opened on your phone and why?**  
Well before Safari—to get this prompt from my website—I think it was Messages to read a text from my mom. We were just talking about some random stuff to buy from Target. Thrilling!
