## Journal
Hello Friday  

Kind of an open day to do whatever I feel like. Not sure which tasks to prioritize today. I’ve been meaning to write a newsletter for the shop, I could do that. I could finalize a Deco sheet I started. Or I could start a totally new design. Hmm… not sure what would be best. Maybe finishing my deco sheet for a quick-ish win? It didn’t cut through last time and I have zero idea why. All the settings were the same as ever. New blade and pretty new sticky mat.  

Oh I finished another jigsaw puzzle last night. I have 3 I’d like to glue together now. I just hate the smell of the glue so I also procrastinate that task. I think my 2nd part of my Hobonichi order should arrive today. Yay! I’ll have everything I need.  

Later… worked on shop stuff. I figured out why my cuts were messed up—a tiny scrap of sticker paper got stuck to the blade. It was cutting most lines but not all the way. So I added a few imperfects/seconds for a discount to my Etsy. Then finished the Winter Floral deco and got it listed. Even got more inventory up to better levels and figured out my 2nd machine just needed a new cutting mat. So I was able to do a lot! Yay!
