## Journal
It’s the last official day of summer! I’m ready for it to go. It was a very slow morning. No reason but I was just sleepy and cozy in bed. I’ve been working hard lately so I’m saying it’s okay if today is just chill.  

Last night my brain rapidly melted down. Not 100%, but borderline existential crisis mode. I just have an order that went missing but it was marked delivered. So I can’t file an insurance claim or even a missing mail search. It just makes me sad that I can’t control the entire process and it costs me—despite doing all the “right” things to protect my orders.  

So I was just questioning my life decision to run my own business and all the stress that means for me. I just wonder sometimes if working for someone else would make me feel more secure. Ultimately I still believe my shop is absolutely the best choice for me, but there are doubts. And I don’t have any business partner to talk me through it so I need to give myself the pep talk.  

The grind is a real thing and stickers are a brutal business. The amount of SKUs required to stay relevant is a bit wild for one person. And maybe it never makes any profit. At least people are connecting with my art. That’s a rare and special thing!
