## Journal
I spent all of yesterday designing a new sticker kit. I’m still finishing up the coloring portion. It has some really beautiful scenes but maybe a tiny bit too much detail? Idk, maybe just the right amount. It’s got strong winter vibes so I can’t procrastinate on this one! I’m excited to use it myself.  

My troubled TikTok package finally got scanned into the system in Florida of all places. No place to scan it between Wisconsin and Florida?! At least it’s finally in there.  

They should be finishing up the pavement repairs today but my van is parked one street over so I’ll have to walk a little to get to it. I repeat: Summer go away, you are no longer welcome here. I want fall!  

This ink is too light on this paper.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 8: What is your current favorite little luxury?**  
The thing I splurge on most often is stickers. It’s a small thing that is just designed to make planning and journaling more fun. I get to find visuals that match my inner feelings.  
It really has helped so much in the past year too that I’ve been consistently journaling. I know my ADHD brain would get bored if it was all text and no fun art. I am so much more organized in my thoughts now. But yes it is a luxury because it’s not required for living—just really nice to have.
