## Journal
Man my sleep has been so inconsistent lately. Very strange. Anyway, today is a work day. Next week I had to reschedule my dentist appt to Thursday because they didn’t have any other days. I also got some sticker sheets cut yesterday. Somehow I oversold by 1 so I had to restock ASAP. I’m always super diligent with my inventory tracking so I don’t know what happened. I’m gonna blame the tools. Not human error. Ha!! Probably, actually my fault somewhere. I wonder if other shop owners under list their inventory by 1–10 or something so they don’t oversell? The idea of keeping multiple versions of my inventory sounds more complicated than I want.

## Prompt
**Prompt 14: If you had to eat only foods that start with one letter for the day, what letter would you choose?**  
Won’t be a very nutritious day but I’d pick M. I could have a muffin for breakfast, macaroni and cheese for dinner. I don’t know what my snacks/lunch would be tough. Uh… mozzarella string cheese? Oh I could make something mini: like a mini quiche or something. And maybe some milk chocolate or a Mr. Goodbar if I’m craving dessert. IDK this is a HARD question!
