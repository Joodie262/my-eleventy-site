## Journal
It wasn’t too hot to function outside today! Yay!! I went for a walk with M. at a local park. The sun was warm, and there was a nice breeze. We did get attacked by mosquitos in some parts though, which was awful. Totally ruins the peaceful nature vibe. I hate them so much. I may stick to beach-only outdoor trips until we get a first frost here. The flooding probably made them a lot worse. Also there’s still a huge pile of flooding trash in our whole neighborhood. But we got an email that everything was picked up. That’s going to be a problem!

## Prompt
**Prompt 24: Which fictional universe would you happily retire in?**  
I’m trying to think of a magical world that isn’t super dangerous. The faerie world in the Emily Wilde books sounded fun (but not if they abduct me or anything). I haven’t read a lot of fiction where the world is much better than the real one. If it was a perfect world it wouldn’t make an interesting story. I don’t think I read or watch the right things to answer this one.  

Ah I thought of one: *Kiki’s Delivery Service*. Just chill lite-witch vibes. No big scaries. Just a hint of magic in a cozy seaside town. But I’d have a little doggy friend instead of a cat. Sorry cats—you make me sneeze!
