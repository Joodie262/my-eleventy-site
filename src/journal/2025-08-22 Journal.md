## Word
**apathy** *(noun)*  
- refers to either a lack of feeling or emotion, or to a lack of interest or concern  

> Though the girl’s expression communicated apathy, Gina knew her daughter was actually very pleased at having won the Poetry Prize.  

> While the previous mayor’s administration responded to the community’s needs with little more than apathy, city hall under the new leadership is making real changes.  

## Journal
I think today will be a design day. Somehow I feel like I’m already behind for Halloween even though it’s August. I am running out of room in my inventory containers for sticker sheets. It feels like hitting some kind of milestone. I’d be happier if my desk had ample room for more but the current layout is basically full. I’m going to have to re-organize the whole thing to add more space for inventory. A cool problem to have.  

Later… Well I finished, photographed and listed a Halloween Cookie sticker sheet. Woo. Lots of work but glad I have something for the upcoming spooky season. I still have more ideas but we’ll see what keeps my creative flame burning long enough to finish it. Also finished season 2 of *Severance*.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 22: What’s the weirdest compliment you’ve ever received?**  
The first one that comes to mind would be one I got in high school from a “goth kid” who said I’d make a really good “goth” because my skin was so pale. Haha. I suppose it’s better than the other kids who teased me for being pale, but it still remains a compliment I did not know how to respond to.
