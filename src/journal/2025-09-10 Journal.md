## Word
**griot** *(noun)*  
- Refers to any of a class of musician-entertainers of Western Africa whose performances include tribal histories and genealogies.  
- Also used broadly to refer to a storyteller.  
> Tracing her family lineage back to West African griots inspired the singer to focus on storytelling through her music.  

*Note: I have never heard this word. Love one that is totally unfamiliar to me.*  

## Journal
**free day** — Time to choose how to spend it…  

Options, options. I’m considering a beach day but I’m also on a roll with designing new products for the shop. Trying to avoid the dreaded burnout. Oh and my 2026 Hobonichi order from Atlas Stationers is out for delivery! Yay!  

If it arrives soon I could film a lil haul for social media. Or set up pens in it… or stare at it! My other order isn’t supposed to arrive until Friday though. It’s just 3 items from the Tsuki no Iro collection (the index stickers, dot stickers, and add on sticky notes). But no way to know if it will be here soon or not.  

I think I’ll do the beach—shop stuff always waits.  

Later… The beach was cloudy and the waves were tiny so it felt very peaceful and quiet. Then when I got home my 2026 Hobonichi order had arrived! Yay! I have Wave Ave and Foggy Plaid Weeks for next year. Very happy to see them in person and know I’ll have them to use when the time comes.
