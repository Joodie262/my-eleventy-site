## Journal
Ugh a medical anxiety day. My stomach is in knots. I’m trying to stay calm but the dentist will just never be my favorite thing. I’ve actually gotten pretty lucky with my teeth. Only ever had one cavity. And I did have to get 4 wisdom teeth removed but that’s it. So I really have nothing to realistically be anxious about. It’s just the invasion of personal space and interacting like a normal human under the stress. No use not going to the dentist because then it would just be for a big problem somewhere down the line. I’ll be an adult today…

**Later** All done being an adult. Zero troubles. Got my X-rays. I went to our local fancy grocery store to look for a treat and I found my fav iced butter cookies. So that was my little reward for being a champ. Tomorrow I’ll do more “productive” things but just trying to deal with the anxiety was enough for today.  

Oh I got to see the full 2026 Hobo lineup this evening. None of the covers are screaming “must buy” but when I start seeing real people hold them I might change my mind. There is one plaid shirt fabric one that I might get. I might have to go for a cover/book combo if I want one at all since you can’t buy the covers alone for some reason. I do want those index tabs though… I think.
