## Journal
Phew! Yesterday was a lot of work. My back is sore today. And now that I moved furniture around I sort of need to go through piles of stationery that had accumulated without a home. So I probably need to spend most of today in a similar "cleaning mode" even though I'm tired. Maybe tomorrow will be my recovery day.  

Later: Spent the whole day decluttering part of my room. It was a lot harder than expected and my brain was completely fried from decision fatigue. I did get 2 trash cans full and out of my room.  

Then... because FATIGUE‚ÄîI watched a Marvel movie with M. And I totally forgot the Hobonichi launch!!! I didn‚Äôt remember for over an hour when I got upstairs for the night time and looked at my phone. Soooo I got everything I wanted but I had to buy from two stores. Not perfect but not a big deal either. Now it‚Äôs just the wait for what will feel like an eternity before it all arrives. Did all USA shops since the tariffs are a giant mystery. Can‚Äôt wait to see people unbox their planners in vlogs on YouTube.
