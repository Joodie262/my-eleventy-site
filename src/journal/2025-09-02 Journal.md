## Journal
I was strangely tired last night. I didn’t use much physical energy, but I guess the mental load was high. Accounting day always has me questioning my entire business model. Wondering if I could be doing more, etc. August was my worst financial month of the year so far. But I made multiple new products that I’m proud of. So I just have to keep believing in myself and my intuition about products.  

## Prompt
**Prompt 2: What everyday task becomes a little more satisfying in fall?**  
The first thing I think of is driving. To and from work or anywhere. I get to watch the leaves change! It just makes something ordinary something special. I get to track the same trees over time and watch them shift at different paces. Some start early. Some hold on for a long time. It will be a while before we see peak color but I can see the tiniest hints of it in a tree here and there if I look closely. I personally feel like this month usually feels more like summer to me, but this year we’ve had a quick shift in weather from summer humidity to dryer/colder temps and I’m so happy about it. Now if we can just get a frost to murder these mosquitos I’d be very happy.
