## Journal
Yesterday was a good day. I hadn’t planned on designing 3 whole sticker sheets but it worked out. I’m still stuck, unable to use Adobe Illustrator when I’m cutting stickers but the calendars get started in Affinity Publisher so I could actually do design and cutting at the same time. Like I used to be able to. I really, really need a laptop so I can overcome that software glitch in the future.  It’s incredibly slowing to my whole work process. I cannot believe they haven’t fixed it yet either. I might have to figure out a stopgap workflow in Affinity Designer for awhile. I just don’t know if it has all the path tools I need like offset, simplify, smooth, etc.  
Very HIGH energy and productive day!  

TCMC subscription arrived and I organized my whole sticker collection in binders. Yay!  

## Prompt
**Prompt 16: If you were a candle scent, what would be in your blend?**  
Well, I think I’d mostly have something sweet like vanilla. I’m generally a kind/sweet person with a big heart. Maybe some cinnamon for my neurospicy nature. I lean towards intensity when I do have emotions tho so maybe a hint of something stronger. I’m no fragrance expert. Maybe amber for the drama and some complexity.
